Unlike traditional computers that process information in binary bits, quantum computers use quantum bits or \"qubits\" that can exist in multiple states simultaneously.\n\n## Fundamental Principles\n\n### Classical vs. Quantum Bits\n\n**Classical bits** exist in one of two definite states: 0 or 1. All traditional computing operations are built on manipulating these binary values.\n\n**Qubits**, however, leverage three quantum mechanical phenomena:\n\n1. **Superposition**: Qubits can exist in a combination of both 0 and 1 states simultaneously until measured. This allows quantum computers to process multiple possibilities at once.\n\n2. **Entanglement**: When qubits become entangled, the state of one qubit instantaneously correlates with another, regardless of distance. This creates powerful correlations impossible in classical systems.\n\n3. **Interference**: Quantum algorithms manipulate probability amplitudes so that incorrect answers cancel out (destructive interference) while correct answers amplify (constructive interference).\n\n## How Quantum Computers Work\n\n### Physical Implementation\n\nQubits can be physically realized through various technologies:\n- **Superconducting circuits** (used by IBM and Google)\n- **Trapped ions** (used by IonQ and Honeywell)\n- **Photonic systems**\n- **Topological qubits** (being developed by Microsoft)\n- **Neutral atoms**\n- **Quantum dots**\n\n### Quantum Gates and Circuits\n\nSimilar to classical logic gates (AND, OR, NOT), quantum computers use quantum gates to manipulate qubits. However, quantum gates are reversible and operate on superposition states, creating complex interference patterns that encode computational results.\n\n### Measurement\n\nWhen qubits are measured, their superposition collapses to definite classical states (0 or 1). Quantum algorithms are designed so that measurement yields the correct answer with high probability.\n\n## Advantages and Applications\n\n### Computational Advantages\n\nQuantum computers excel at specific problem types:\n\n**1.
