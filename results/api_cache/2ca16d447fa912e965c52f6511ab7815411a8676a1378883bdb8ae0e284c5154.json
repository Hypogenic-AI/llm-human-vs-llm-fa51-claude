It stores energy chemically and releases it as electricity on demand.\n\n## Fundamental Principles\n\n### Basic Components\n\nEvery battery contains three essential elements:\n\n1. **Anode (Negative Electrode)** - Where oxidation occurs; releases electrons\n2. **Cathode (Positive Electrode)** - Where reduction occurs; accepts electrons\n3. **Electrolyte** - A medium (liquid, gel, or solid) that allows ion flow while preventing direct electron transfer between electrodes\n\n### The Electrochemical Process\n\n**During Discharge (providing power):**\n\n1. **At the Anode:** Oxidation reaction releases electrons into the external circuit\n2. **Through the Circuit:** Electrons flow through your device, providing power\n3. **At the Cathode:** Reduction reaction accepts electrons from the circuit\n4. **Through the Electrolyte:** Ions migrate internally to maintain charge balance\n\n**During Charging (rechargeable batteries only):**\n- The process reverses when external voltage is applied\n- Electrical energy converts back to chemical energy\n\n## Detailed Example: Lithium-Ion Battery\n\n### Structure\n- **Anode:** Graphite (carbon)\n- **Cathode:** Lithium metal oxide (e.g., LiCoO\u2082)\n- **Electrolyte:** Lithium salt in organic solvent\n- **Separator:** Porous membrane preventing short circuits\n\n### Operation\n\n**Discharge:**\n- Lithium ions (Li\u207a) move from anode to cathode through electrolyte\n- Electrons flow through external circuit (powering your device)\n- Chemical reaction: Li \u2192 Li\u207a + e\u207b (at anode)\n\n**Charge:**\n- External power forces lithium ions back to anode\n- Energy is stored in chemical bonds\n\n## Types of Batteries\n\n### Primary Batteries (Non-rechargeable)\n\n**Alkaline Batteries**\n- Anode: Zinc\n- Cathode: Manganese dioxide\n- Electrolyte: Pot", "timestamp": 1770754350.4138646}
