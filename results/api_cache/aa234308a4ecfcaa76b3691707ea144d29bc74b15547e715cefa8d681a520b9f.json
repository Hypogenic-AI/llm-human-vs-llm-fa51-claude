Understanding these causes helps explain why prices rise and how economies function.\n\n## 1. **Demand-Pull Inflation**\n\nThis occurs when aggregate demand exceeds aggregate supply.\n\n### Key drivers:\n- **Increased consumer spending** from rising wages or consumer confidence\n- **Government spending** through fiscal stimulus or infrastructure projects\n- **Monetary expansion** when central banks lower interest rates or increase money supply\n- **Export demand** when foreign buyers increase purchases\n- **Investment booms** during periods of business optimism\n\n**Example:** Post-pandemic recovery saw pent-up consumer demand outpacing supply capacity, contributing to inflation.\n\n## 2. **Cost-Push Inflation**\n\nPrices rise due to increased production costs, forcing producers to pass costs to consumers.\n\n### Primary sources:\n- **Rising wages** without corresponding productivity gains\n- **Increased raw material costs** (oil, metals, agricultural products)\n- **Supply chain disruptions** that increase transportation and logistics costs\n- **Import price increases** from currency depreciation or foreign inflation\n- **Regulatory costs** from new environmental or safety standards\n\n**Example:** The 1970s oil shocks dramatically increased energy costs, triggering widespread inflation.\n\n## 3. **Monetary Factors**\n\n### Money Supply Growth:\n- **Excessive money printing** by central banks\n- **Quantitative easing** programs that inject liquidity\n- **Low interest rates** encouraging borrowing and spending\n- Following the **Quantity Theory of Money** (MV = PQ), if money supply (M) grows faster than output (Q), prices (P) must rise\n\n**Historical example:** Hyperinflation in Zimbabwe and Weimar Germany resulted from uncontrolled money printing.\n\n## 4. **Built-In Inflation (Wage-Price Spiral)**\n\nA self-perpetuating cycle where:\n- Workers demand higher wages to maintain purchasing power\n- Businesses raise prices to cover increased labor costs\n- Higher prices prompt further wage demands\n- **Inflation expectations** become embedded in economic behavior\n\n## 5. **Supply Shocks**\n\nSudden disruptions to supply:", "timestamp": 1770754509.88242}
