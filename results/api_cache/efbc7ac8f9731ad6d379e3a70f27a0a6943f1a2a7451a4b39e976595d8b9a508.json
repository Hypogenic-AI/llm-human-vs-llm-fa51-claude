It consists of two interconnected theories: **Special Relativity** (1905) and **General Relativity** (1915).\n\n## Special Relativity (1905)\n\n### Fundamental Principles\n\n**1. The Principle of Relativity**\n- The laws of physics are the same in all inertial (non-accelerating) reference frames\n- No experiment can determine absolute motion; only relative motion matters\n\n**2. The Constancy of Light Speed**\n- The speed of light in a vacuum (c \u2248 299,792,458 m/s) is constant for all observers, regardless of their motion or the motion of the light source\n\n### Key Consequences\n\n**Time Dilation**\n- Moving clocks run slower relative to stationary observers\n- The faster an object moves, the more time slows down for it\n- Formula: t' = t/\u221a(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2)\n\n**Length Contraction**\n- Objects contract in the direction of motion when moving at high speeds\n- A moving object appears shorter to a stationary observer\n\n**Relativity of Simultaneity**\n- Events that appear simultaneous in one frame may not be simultaneous in another\n- There is no absolute \"now\" across the universe\n\n**Mass-Energy Equivalence**\n- Einstein's famous equation: **E = mc\u00b2**\n- Mass and energy are interchangeable\n- Even stationary objects contain enormous amounts of energy\n\n## General Relativity (1915)\n\n### Fundamental Concept\n\nGeneral relativity extends special relativity to include gravity and acceleration. Its central insight is that **gravity is not a force but a curvature of spacetime caused by mass and energy**.\n\n### Key Principles\n\n**1. Equivalence Principle**\n- Gravitational acceleration is indistinguishable from acceleration due to motion\n- An observer in a closed box cannot tell whether they're being pulled by gravity or accelerated upward\n\n**2. Spacetime Curvature**\n- Massive objects bend the", "timestamp": 1770754183.909332}
