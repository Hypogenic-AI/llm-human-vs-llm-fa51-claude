Here\u2019s how it works, simply:\n\n1. **Design**: You make or download a 3D model on a computer.\n2. **Slice**: The model is split into thin layers using special software.\n3. **Print**: The 3D printer builds the object by adding material (like plastic) one layer at a time, following the sliced design.\n\nIt\u2019s like building something out of many thin, flat pieces stacked on top of each other!", "timestamp": 1770753795.5844615}
