The British driver who broke the land speed record was **Richard Noble**, but he did so in **1983**, not 1990, driving **Thrust 2** (not \"Thrust 2\" in 1990).\n\nRichard Noble set the record at 633.468 mph (1,019.468 km/h) in the Black Rock Desert, Nevada, in October 1983.\n\nIn 1997, another Brit, **Andy Green**, broke the land speed record in **ThrustSSC** (Thrust SuperSonic Car), becoming the first person to break the sound barrier on land.", "timestamp": 1770751000.6961124}
