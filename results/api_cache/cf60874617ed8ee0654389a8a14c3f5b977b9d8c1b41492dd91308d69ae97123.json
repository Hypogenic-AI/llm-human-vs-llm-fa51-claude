Here are the main stages:\n\n## Key Processes\n\n1. **Evaporation** - Water from oceans, lakes, and rivers turns into water vapor due to heat from the sun\n\n2. **Transpiration** - Plants release water vapor through their leaves\n\n3. **Condensation** - Water vapor cools and forms clouds and fog\n\n4. **Precipitation** - Water falls back to Earth as rain, snow, sleet, or hail\n\n5. **Collection** - Water gathers in bodies of water (oceans, rivers, lakes) or soaks into the ground (infiltration)\n\n6. **Runoff** - Water flows over land back to larger bodies of water\n\n## Why It Matters\n\n- Provides fresh water for drinking, agriculture, and ecosystems\n- Regulates Earth's temperature\n- Distributes heat around the planet\n- Supports all life on Earth\n\nThe cycle has no real beginning or end\u2014it's been recycling the same water for billions of years. The water you drink today could have once been part of a dinosaur's drink!", "timestamp": 1770754463.8305376}
