It could simply mean that Carson Wentz went ice skating, which is plausible for any individual, including athletes from other sports.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe sentence is plausible, as it is reasonable to imagine Carson Wentz, or any person, stepping onto an ice rink for recreational or other purposes.\n\n**Final Answer:**  \n**Yes.**", "timestamp": 1770751820.9270349}
