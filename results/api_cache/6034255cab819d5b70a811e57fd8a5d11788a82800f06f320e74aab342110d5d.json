Here's the basic process:\n\n## The Main Cause: Tectonic Plates\n\n- Earth's outer layer is broken into massive pieces called **tectonic plates**\n- These plates constantly move (very slowly - just a few centimeters per year)\n- They can slide past each other, collide, or pull apart\n\n## The Build-Up\n\n1. **Friction locks plates together** at their edges (called faults)\n2. Even though they're stuck, the plates keep trying to move\n3. **Stress and energy build up** over years, decades, or centuries\n4. It's like bending a stick more and more\n\n## The Release\n\n1. Eventually, the stress becomes too great\n2. The plates suddenly **slip and move** - the \"stick breaks\"\n3. This releases all that stored energy as **seismic waves**\n4. These waves travel through the Earth, shaking the ground\n\n## The Result\n\n- The point where the rupture starts is the **focus** (or hypocenter)\n- The point directly above it on the surface is the **epicenter**\n- Shaking can last seconds to minutes\n- Stronger earthquakes release more energy\n\n**Simple analogy**: It's like snapping your fingers - you build up pressure, then suddenly release it, creating a sound wave. Earthquakes work similarly, but with rock and much more energy!", "timestamp": 1770754193.2429373}
