Adam Thielen is an NFL wide receiver, and \"added time\" (also called \"stoppage time\") is a term commonly used in soccer, but in American football context, it would refer to time added back to the clock due to penalties or other stoppages. \n\nHowever, if you mean \"added time\" in the soccer sense, it would be unusual since Thielen plays football, not soccer. But in an NFL context, a player could certainly score a touchdown in the final moments of a game when time has been added back to the clock.\n\nSo it depends on the context - **plausible for NFL, but mixing sports terminology if you meant soccer's \"added time.\"**", "timestamp": 1770752167.8247054}
