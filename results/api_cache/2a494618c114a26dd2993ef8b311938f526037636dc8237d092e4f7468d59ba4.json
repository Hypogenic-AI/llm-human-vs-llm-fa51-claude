Here\u2019s how it works, simply:\n\n1. **Variation:** Every living thing is a little different from others of its kind.\n2. **Inheritance:** Some of these differences are passed from parents to offspring.\n3. **Selection:** Some differences help an organism survive and have babies. Those helpful traits are more likely to be passed on.\n4. **Time:** Over many generations, these small changes add up, and species can change or even become new species.\n\nIn short: **Living things change over time because helpful traits get passed on more often.**", "timestamp": 1770753625.67051}
