You type \"www.example.com\" into your browser\n2. Your request travels through cables/wifi to your ISP\n3. The request bounces through multiple routers to find the right server\n4. The server sends the website data back to you\n5. Your browser displays the page\n\n## Key Points\n\n- **Everything has an address** - just like houses have street addresses, devices have IP addresses (like 192.168.1.1)\n- **Data travels in packets** - information breaks into small chunks, travels separately, then reassembles at the destination\n- **It's physical** - the internet runs on actual cables under oceans and streets, plus satellites and cell towers\n\nThat's it! The internet is basically millions of computers talking to each other through a massive network of connections.", "timestamp": 1770754224.6869853}
