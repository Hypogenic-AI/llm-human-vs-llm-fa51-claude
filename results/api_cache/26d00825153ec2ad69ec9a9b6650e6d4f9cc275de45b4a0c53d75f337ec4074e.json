Here's a detailed explanation of the process and technology:\n\n## The Basic Process\n\n### 1. **Digital Design Creation**\n- A 3D model is created using Computer-Aided Design (CAD) software or obtained through 3D scanning\n- The design file is typically saved in formats like STL, OBJ, or AMF\n- The model is then \"sliced\" using specialized software that divides it into hundreds or thousands of thin horizontal layers\n\n### 2. **Preparation and Slicing**\n- Slicing software generates instructions (G-code) that tell the printer exactly how to build each layer\n- Users can adjust settings like layer height, print speed, infill density, and support structures\n- The file is transferred to the 3D printer via USB, SD card, or wireless connection\n\n### 3. **Layer-by-Layer Construction**\n- The printer builds the object from bottom to top, one thin layer at a time\n- Each layer bonds to the one below it, gradually forming the complete object\n- Layer thickness typically ranges from 0.1mm to 0.3mm, though some printers can go finer\n\n## Main 3D Printing Technologies\n\n### **Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM/FFF)**\n- **Most common and affordable method**\n- Thermoplastic filament is heated to melting point and extruded through a nozzle\n- The nozzle moves in X and Y directions while the build platform moves vertically (Z-axis)\n- Materials: PLA, ABS, PETG, TPU, nylon, and specialty composites\n- Best for: Prototypes, functional parts, hobbyist projects\n\n### **Stereolithography (SLA)**\n- Uses a UV laser to cure and solidify liquid photopolymer resin\n- The laser traces each layer's pattern on the resin surface\n- The build platform gradually rises or lowers as layers complete\n- Materials: Various photosensitive resins\n- Best for: High-detail models, jewelry, dental applications", "timestamp": 1770754528.626703}
