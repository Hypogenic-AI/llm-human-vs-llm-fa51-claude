Understanding their mechanisms can help appreciate both their importance and limitations.\n\n## Basic Principle\n\nAntibiotics work by **selectively targeting bacteria** while leaving human cells relatively unharmed. This selectivity is possible because bacterial cells have different structures and metabolic processes than human cells.\n\n## Main Mechanisms of Action\n\n### 1. **Inhibiting Cell Wall Synthesis**\n- **Examples:** Penicillins, cephalosporins, vancomycin\n- Bacteria have rigid cell walls made of peptidoglycan (humans don't have cell walls)\n- These antibiotics prevent bacteria from building or repairing their protective walls\n- Without intact walls, bacteria burst from internal pressure\n\n### 2. **Disrupting Protein Synthesis**\n- **Examples:** Tetracyclines, macrolides (like erythromycin), aminoglycosides\n- Target bacterial ribosomes (protein-making machinery)\n- Bacterial ribosomes differ structurally from human ribosomes\n- Prevents bacteria from producing essential proteins needed for survival\n\n### 3. **Interfering with DNA/RNA Synthesis**\n- **Examples:** Fluoroquinolones (like ciprofloxacin), rifampin\n- Block enzymes bacteria need to replicate their genetic material\n- Prevents bacterial reproduction and DNA repair\n\n### 4. **Disrupting Cell Membrane Function**\n- **Examples:** Polymyxins, daptomycin\n- Damage the bacterial cell membrane\n- Causes leakage of cellular contents, leading to cell death\n\n### 5. **Inhibiting Metabolic Pathways**\n- **Examples:** Sulfonamides, trimethoprim\n- Block specific enzymes in bacterial folic acid synthesis\n- Bacteria must make their own folic acid; humans obtain it from diet\n\n## Bactericidal vs. Bacteriostatic\n\n- **Bactericidal antibiotics** directly kill bacteria (e.g., penicillins, fluoroquinolones)\n- **Bacteriostatic antibiotics** stop bacterial growth and reproduction, allowing the immune system to eliminate them (e.g., tetracyclines,", "timestamp": 1770754020.0328286}
