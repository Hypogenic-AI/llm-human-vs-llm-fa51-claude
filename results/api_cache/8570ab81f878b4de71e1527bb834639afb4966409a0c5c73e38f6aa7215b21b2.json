It features three horizontal stripes (red, black, and green) with a white crescent and star in the center black stripe.\n\n## Historical Flag (1977-2011)\nHowever, from **1977 to 2011**, under Muammar Gaddafi's rule, Libya's flag was indeed a **plain green rectangle** - making it the only national flag in the world at that time to consist of just one solid color with no design, insignia, or other details.\n\nIf your question refers to this historical period, the answer is **green** - representing Gaddafi's political philosophy and Islam.", "timestamp": 1770750628.068983}
