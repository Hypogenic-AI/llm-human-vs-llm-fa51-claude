Here\u2019s a simple explanation of how **GPS (Global Positioning System)** works:\n\n### 1. **Satellites in Space**\n- There are at least **24 GPS satellites** orbiting the Earth.\n- These satellites constantly send out signals with their location and the exact time.\n\n### 2. **Your GPS Receiver**\n- Your phone, car navigation, or any GPS device has a **receiver**.\n- The receiver listens for signals from several GPS satellites (at least 4 for best accuracy).\n\n### 3. **Measuring Distance**\n- The receiver calculates **how long** it took for each satellite\u2019s signal to reach it.\n- Since radio signals travel at the speed of light, the receiver can figure out how far away each satellite is.\n\n### 4. **Triangulation (Actually, Trilateration)**\n- By knowing its distance from at least **three satellites**, the receiver can figure out its position on Earth (latitude and longitude).\n- A fourth satellite helps determine altitude and corrects for any timing errors.\n\n### 5. **Result: Your Location**\n- The GPS receiver combines all this information to pinpoint **where you are**\u2014often within a few meters!\n\n---\n\n**In summary:**  \nGPS works by using signals from satellites to measure distances and calculate your exact location on Earth.\n\nIf you want more technical details or have a specific question, let me know!", "timestamp": 1770753323.0224116}
