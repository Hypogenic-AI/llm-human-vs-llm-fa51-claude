However, I should note that it starred **Jim Belushi** (not James, though that is his full first name - James Adam Belushi). It was a miniseries that aired on ABC and was indeed based on Bruce Wagner's comic strip that originally appeared in Details magazine. The show was a cyberpunk drama about virtual reality, cults, and political intrigue set in Los Angeles in 2007.", "timestamp": 1770750720.4362202}
