Here's what we know:\n\n## What we observe:\n- **Galaxies spin too fast** - Stars at the edges of galaxies move so quickly they should fly apart, but something invisible is holding them together with extra gravity\n- **Gravitational lensing** - Light from distant objects bends around invisible mass\n- **Galaxy clusters** - Clusters contain far more gravitational mass than we can account for with visible matter\n\n## What it's NOT:\n- Not regular matter (atoms) that's just dark - we've ruled that out\n- Not black holes or dead stars - there aren't enough of them\n- Doesn't interact with light at all (doesn't emit, absorb, or reflect it)\n\n## What it might be:\nThe leading candidates are exotic particles that barely interact with normal matter:\n- **WIMPs** (Weakly Interacting Massive Particles)\n- **Axions** (extremely light particles)\n- Other theoretical particles we haven't discovered yet\n\n## The mystery:\nDespite decades of searching with increasingly sensitive detectors, we haven't directly detected dark matter particles yet. We only know it exists because of its gravitational effects.\n\nIt's one of the biggest unsolved puzzles in physics!", "timestamp": 1770754536.713107}
