Here\u2019s a detailed and informative explanation of how **blockchain technology** works:\n\n---\n\n## What is Blockchain Technology?\n\n**Blockchain** is a type of distributed ledger technology (DLT) that enables data to be stored globally on thousands of servers while letting anyone on the network see everyone else\u2019s entries in near real-time. This makes it very difficult to alter any single record without altering all subsequent records and gaining consensus from the network majority.\n\n---\n\n## How Does Blockchain Work?\n\n### 1. **Structure: Blocks and Chains**\n\n- **Block:** A block is a digital container that holds a batch of transactions or data.\n- **Chain:** Each block is linked to the previous one, forming a chronological chain\u2014hence the name \"blockchain.\"\n\nEach block typically contains:\n- A list of transactions/data\n- A timestamp\n- A reference (hash) to the previous block\n- Its own unique hash (a cryptographic fingerprint)\n\n### 2. **Decentralization**\n\nUnlike traditional databases managed by a central authority, a blockchain is **decentralized**. Copies of the blockchain are maintained by multiple computers (nodes) across the network. Every node has the same version of the ledger.\n\n### 3. **Consensus Mechanisms**\n\nTo add a new block, network participants must agree on its validity. This is achieved through **consensus mechanisms**. The most common are:\n\n- **Proof of Work (PoW):** Used by Bitcoin. Miners solve complex mathematical puzzles to validate transactions and add new blocks.\n- **Proof of Stake (PoS):** Used by Ethereum 2.0 and others. Validators are chosen to create new blocks based on the amount of cryptocurrency they \"stake\" as collateral.\n\n### 4. **Transaction Process**\n\nHere\u2019s a simplified step-by-step process:\n\n1. **Transaction Initiation:** A user requests a transaction (e.g., sending cryptocurrency).\n2. **Broadcast:** The transaction is broadcast to the network of nodes.\n3. **Validation:** Nodes validate the transaction using the consensus mechanism.\n4. **Block Creation:** Valid transactions are grouped into a new block.\n5. **Block Addition:** The new block is added to the blockchain, linked to the previous block.\n6. **Ledger Update:** The updated blockchain is distributed to all nodes, ensuring everyone has the same record.\n\n### 5. **Immutability and Security**\n\n- **Immutability:** Once a block is added, it cannot be altered without", "timestamp": 1770753432.0906045}
