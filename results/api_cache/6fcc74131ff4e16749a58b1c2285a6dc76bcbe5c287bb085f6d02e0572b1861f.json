This is called \"fission.\"\n\n2. **Heat is Released** - When atoms split, they release enormous amounts of heat energy.\n\n3. **Boiling Water** - That heat boils water to create steam (just like a giant kettle).\n\n4. **Spinning Turbines** - The steam spins large turbines connected to generators.\n\n5. **Making Electricity** - The spinning generators produce electricity that goes to the power grid.\n\n**Why It's Powerful:**\nSplitting just one atom releases millions of times more energy than burning one molecule of coal or gas. That's why a small amount of nuclear fuel can power a city for a long time.\n\n**The Bottom Line:**\nNuclear energy is basically a very sophisticated way to boil water using the energy locked inside atoms instead of burning fossil fuels.", "timestamp": 1770754300.4935596}
