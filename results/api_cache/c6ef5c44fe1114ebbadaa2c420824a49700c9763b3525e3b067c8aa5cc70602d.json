The FA Cup is a domestic cup competition in England, and Chiellini has never played for an English club, nor has he participated in the FA Cup. Therefore, it would not be possible for him to have committed a handball in that competition.\n\nIf you have any other questions about football or Giorgio Chiellini, feel free to ask!", "timestamp": 1770751871.0793495}
