He was an American deep-sea diver and inventor who, along with William Beebe, developed the bathysphere in the 1930s. This spherical deep-sea submersible allowed them to make record-breaking descents into the ocean depths, reaching over 3,000 feet (about 923 meters) below the surface - unprecedented at the time. Their explorations helped advance our understanding of deep-sea life and ocean environments.", "timestamp": 1770750906.832305}
