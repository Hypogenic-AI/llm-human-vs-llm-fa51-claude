In Lewis Carroll's \"The Hunting of the Snark,\" the Snark doesn't turn into something else to fool hunters.\n\nRather, the poem warns that some Snarks are actually **Boojums**. The famous last line reveals that the Baker's Snark \"was a Boojum, you see\" - and when a Snark turns out to be a Boojum, the hunter \"softly and suddenly vanishes away.\"\n\nSo it's not that the Snark transforms to fool hunters - it's that some Snarks ARE Boojums, and encountering a Boojum causes the hunter to disappear, which is what happens to the Baker at the poem's end.", "timestamp": 1770755352.0648139}
