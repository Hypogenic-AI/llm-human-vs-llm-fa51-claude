While he was known for his reliable hands and clutch performances, like any player who handles the ball frequently, it is possible and plausible that he could have fumbled the ball during a game. In fact, Edelman did have a few fumbles over the course of his career. So, the sentence is both grammatically correct and factually plausible.", "timestamp": 1770751964.1159296}
