Without this effect, Earth would be approximately 33\u00b0C (59\u00b0F) colder, with an average temperature of about -18\u00b0C (0\u00b0F) instead of the current 15\u00b0C (59\u00b0F).\n\n## How the Greenhouse Effect Works\n\n### The Basic Mechanism\n\n1. **Solar Radiation Arrives**: The Sun emits energy primarily as visible light and ultraviolet radiation, which passes relatively easily through Earth's atmosphere.\n\n2. **Surface Absorption**: Earth's surface (land and oceans) absorbs approximately 70% of this incoming solar energy and warms up.\n\n3. **Infrared Emission**: The warmed surface re-radiates this energy as infrared radiation (heat), which has longer wavelengths than visible light.\n\n4. **Atmospheric Trapping**: Greenhouse gases in the atmosphere absorb much of this outgoing infrared radiation and re-emit it in all directions, including back toward Earth's surface.\n\n5. **Temperature Increase**: This re-radiated heat warms both the lower atmosphere and the surface, creating the greenhouse effect.\n\n## Key Greenhouse Gases\n\n### Natural Greenhouse Gases\n\n- **Water Vapor (H\u2082O)**: The most abundant greenhouse gas, responsible for about 60% of the natural greenhouse effect\n- **Carbon Dioxide (CO\u2082)**: Accounts for approximately 20% of the natural effect\n- **Methane (CH\u2084)**: Much more effective at trapping heat than CO\u2082, though less abundant\n- **Nitrous Oxide (N\u2082O)**: Long-lasting and potent greenhouse gas\n- **Ozone (O\u2083)**: Present in both the stratosphere and troposphere\n\n### Human-Enhanced Gases\n\n- **Additional CO\u2082**: From burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial processes\n- **Additional Methane**: From agriculture (livestock, rice paddies), landfills, and fossil fuel extraction\n- **Synthetic Gases**: Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), hydrofluorocarbons", "timestamp": 1770754366.6890619}
