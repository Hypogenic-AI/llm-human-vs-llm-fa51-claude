The Great Depression was a severe worldwide economic downturn that began in 1929 and lasted through much of the 1930s. There were several interconnected causes:\n\n### 1. **Stock Market Crash of 1929**\n- In October 1929, the U.S. stock market crashed, wiping out billions of dollars in wealth. Many people had bought stocks on margin (with borrowed money), so when prices fell, they couldn't pay back their loans, leading to panic selling and further declines.\n\n### 2. **Bank Failures**\n- As the economy worsened, many banks failed. People lost their savings, and surviving banks became more cautious, reducing lending and further slowing economic activity.\n\n### 3. **Reduction in Consumer Spending**\n- With lost savings and jobs, people spent less. Businesses responded by cutting production and laying off more workers, creating a vicious cycle of unemployment and reduced demand.\n\n### 4. **Decline in International Trade**\n- The U.S. and other countries raised tariffs (taxes on imports) to protect their industries (e.g., the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930). This led to a drop in international trade, hurting economies worldwide.\n\n### 5. **Drought and Agricultural Collapse**\n- In the U.S., the Dust Bowl (a severe drought in the Midwest) devastated farms, leading to further economic hardship for rural communities.\n\n### 6. **Unequal Distribution of Wealth**\n- In the 1920s, wealth was concentrated among a small portion of the population. Most people didn\u2019t have enough money to sustain demand for goods and services, making the economy vulnerable to shocks.\n\n### 7. **Monetary Policy Mistakes**\n- The Federal Reserve (the U.S. central bank) made errors, such as raising interest rates and not providing enough support to struggling banks, which worsened the crisis.\n\n---\n\n**In summary:**  \nThe Great Depression was caused by a combination of financial market collapse, banking failures, reduced consumer spending, trade barriers, agricultural problems, unequal wealth distribution, and poor policy decisions. These factors interacted to create a deep and prolonged economic crisis.\n\nIf you want more detail on any specific cause, let me know!", "timestamp": 1770753537.6110368}
