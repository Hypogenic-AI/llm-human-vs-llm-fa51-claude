The mythological beast you are describing is the **Manticore**.\n\n**Description:**\n- **Head of a man**\n- **Body of a lion**\n- **Tail of a dragon** (sometimes described as a scorpion or dragon tail)\n- **Feet of a dragon** (in some versions)\n\nThe **Manticore** is a legendary creature from Persian mythology, later adopted into European folklore. Its name means \"man-eater.\" The classic depiction is a creature with the face of a man, the body of a lion, and a tail that can be either that of a dragon or a scorpion, sometimes with spines or barbs that it can shoot as projectiles. Some medieval illustrations also give it dragon-like feet.\n\nIf you meant a different creature, let me know! But the Manticore is the most famous beast with these combined features.", "timestamp": 1770750365.548528}
