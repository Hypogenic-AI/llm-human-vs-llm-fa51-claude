Fundamental Concepts\n\n### What is Electricity?\nElectricity is the flow of electrical charge, primarily carried by electrons moving through conductive materials. At its core, electricity is a fundamental force of nature arising from the behavior of subatomic particles.\n\n### Basic Building Blocks\n- **Atoms**: Consist of protons (positive charge), neutrons (neutral), and electrons (negative charge)\n- **Electrons**: The primary carriers of electrical charge in most circuits\n- **Charge**: The fundamental property that causes electrical phenomena, measured in coulombs (C)\n\n## 2. Key Principles\n\n### Electric Charge\n- Like charges repel; opposite charges attract\n- Charge is conserved\u2014it cannot be created or destroyed\n- Materials can become charged through electron transfer\n\n### Electric Current\n- **Definition**: The rate of flow of electric charge\n- **Measurement**: Amperes (A) = coulombs per second\n- **Direction**: Conventionally flows from positive to negative (opposite to electron flow)\n\n### Voltage (Electric Potential Difference)\n- The \"pressure\" that pushes electrons through a circuit\n- Measured in volts (V)\n- Represents energy per unit charge\n- Created by separation of charges\n\n### Resistance\n- Opposition to current flow\n- Measured in ohms (\u03a9)\n- Depends on material, temperature, length, and cross-sectional area\n- Converts electrical energy to heat\n\n## 3. Ohm's Law: The Fundamental Relationship\n\n**V = I \u00d7 R**\n\nWhere:\n- V = Voltage (volts)\n- I = Current (amperes)\n- R = Resistance (ohms)\n\nThis relationship shows that current is directly proportional to voltage and inversely proportional to resistance.\n\n## 4. Types of Electricity\n\n### Static Electricity\n- Stationary accumulation of charge\n- Created by friction (triboelectric effect)\n- Examples: Lightning, touching a doorknob after walking on carpet\n\n### Current Electricity\n**Direct Current (DC)**\n- Electrons flow in one constant direction\n- Sources: Batteries, solar cells, DC power supplies\n- Uses: Electronics, electric vehicles, LED", "timestamp": 1770754133.668537}
