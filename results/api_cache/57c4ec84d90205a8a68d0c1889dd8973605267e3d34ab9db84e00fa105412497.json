Joshua prayed to God, and the sun stopped in the middle of the sky and delayed going down about a full day, allowing the Israelites to achieve victory over their enemies.\n\nThe passage states: \"On the day the LORD gave the Amorites over to Israel, Joshua said to the LORD in the presence of Israel: 'Sun, stand still over Gibeon, and you, moon, over the Valley of Aijalon.'
