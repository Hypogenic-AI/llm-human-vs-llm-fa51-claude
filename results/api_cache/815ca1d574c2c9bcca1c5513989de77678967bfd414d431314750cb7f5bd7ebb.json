Stauffenberg placed a briefcase containing a bomb in Hitler's conference room at the Wolf's Lair (his military headquarters in East Prussia). The bomb exploded, but Hitler survived with relatively minor injuries, partly because someone had moved the briefcase to the other side of a heavy table leg, which shielded him from the blast.\n\nThe plot's failure led to brutal reprisals, with thousands arrested and about 200 conspirators executed, including Stauffenberg.", "timestamp": 1770750663.6618867}
