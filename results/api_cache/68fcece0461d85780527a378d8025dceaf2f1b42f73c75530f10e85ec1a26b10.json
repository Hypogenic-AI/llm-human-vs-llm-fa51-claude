Here's why:\n\n**Fred VanVleet** is an NBA basketball player (plays for the Houston Rockets, formerly with the Toronto Raptors), not a soccer/football player.\n\n**The issues:**\n- \"Scoring a free kick\" is soccer/football terminology\n- The \"Champions League final\" is a soccer/football competition (UEFA Champions League)\n- Basketball players don't participate in soccer competitions\n\n**To make it plausible, you would need either:**\n- A basketball player + basketball terminology (e.g., \"Fred VanVleet scored a three-pointer in the NBA Finals\")\n- A soccer player + soccer terminology (e.g., \"Lionel Messi scored a free kick in the Champions League final\")", "timestamp": 1770752358.0335293}
