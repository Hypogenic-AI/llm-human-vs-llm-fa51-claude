It actually refers to two related theories:\n\n### 1. **Special Relativity (1905)**\n- **Main idea:** The laws of physics are the same for all observers who are moving at constant speeds relative to each other (inertial frames), and the speed of light in a vacuum is always the same, no matter how fast you are moving.\n- **Key consequences:**\n  - **Time Dilation:** Time passes more slowly for objects moving close to the speed of light compared to those at rest.\n  - **Length Contraction:** Objects moving at high speeds appear shorter in the direction of motion.\n  - **Mass-Energy Equivalence:** Expressed by the famous equation **E = mc\u00b2**, meaning mass and energy are interchangeable.\n\n### 2. **General Relativity (1915)**\n- **Main idea:** Gravity is not a force between masses (as Newton thought), but rather a result of the curvature of space and time (spacetime) caused by mass and energy.\n- **Key consequences:**\n  - **Gravitational Time Dilation:** Time runs slower in stronger gravitational fields.\n  - **Bending of Light:** Light bends when it passes near a massive object (gravitational lensing).\n  - **Black Holes:** Extremely dense regions where spacetime is so curved that not even light can escape.\n\n---\n\n**In summary:**  \nThe theory of relativity revolutionized our understanding of space, time, and gravity, showing that they are interconnected and relative, not absolute. It has been confirmed by many experiments and is essential for technologies like GPS.", "timestamp": 1770753438.3520575}
