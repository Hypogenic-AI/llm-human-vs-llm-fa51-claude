Rather than stemming from a single cause, it resulted from a combination of structural weaknesses, policy failures, and cascading events that created a perfect economic storm.\n\n## Primary Causes\n\n### 1. **The Stock Market Crash of 1929**\nWhile not the sole cause, the October 1929 crash was the triggering event:\n- Rampant speculation and buying stocks \"on margin\" (with borrowed money)\n- Stock prices became disconnected from actual company values\n- The crash destroyed wealth and shattered consumer confidence\n- Banks that had invested heavily in stocks faced insolvency\n\n### 2. **Banking System Failures**\nThe financial system's collapse amplified the crisis:\n- Over 9,000 banks failed during the 1930s\n- No deposit insurance meant ordinary people lost their life savings\n- Bank failures reduced the money supply by one-third\n- Credit became unavailable, strangling business investment\n- Bank runs created panic and further instability\n\n### 3. **Monetary Policy Mistakes**\nThe Federal Reserve made critical errors:\n- Failed to act as a lender of last resort to struggling banks\n- Allowed the money supply to contract sharply (by about 30%)\n- Raised interest rates in 1928-1929 to curb speculation, slowing the economy\n- Did not provide sufficient liquidity during the crisis\n\n### 4. **International Gold Standard**\nThe rigid gold standard constrained recovery:\n- Countries couldn't expand money supplies without gold reserves\n- Forced deflation in many countries\n- Created competitive devaluations and economic nationalism\n- Transmitted economic problems rapidly across borders\n\n## Contributing Factors\n\n### 5. **Overproduction and Underconsumption**\nStructural imbalances plagued the economy:\n- Industrial and agricultural production exceeded demand\n- Technological advances increased productivity but displaced workers\n- Wealth inequality meant limited purchasing power among average consumers\n- Farmers faced chronic overproduction and falling prices throughout the 1920s\n\n### 6. **Income Inequality**\nWealth concentration limited economic resilience:\n- By 1929, the top 1%", "timestamp": 1770754293.2920914}
