Wide receivers are typically not the ones who make the decision to \"go for it\" on fourth down; that decision is made by the coach, and the play is usually executed by the quarterback, running back, or sometimes a special teams player.\n- The phrase **\"went for it on fourth down\"** usually refers to a team or a player (often the quarterback or running back) attempting to convert a fourth down rather than punting or kicking a field goal.\n\n**Possible exceptions:**\n- If Brandin Cooks was involved in a trick play (e.g., a wide receiver pass or a direct snap), or if he was the player who caught a pass on a fourth down attempt, the sentence could technically be accurate,", "timestamp": 1770752040.240263}
