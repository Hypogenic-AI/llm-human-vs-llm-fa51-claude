When banks collapsed, depositors lost their savings, which destroyed purchasing power and credit availability.\n\n**Reduction in Purchasing**\nAs people lost savings and jobs, they bought less. This decreased demand caused businesses to cut production and lay off more workers\u2014a vicious cycle.\n\n**Economic Policy Mistakes**\n- The Federal Reserve tightened money supply when it should have loosened it\n- The Smoot-Hawley Tariff (1930) raised import duties, triggering international trade wars\n- Government initially tried to balance budgets rather than stimulate the economy\n\n**Overproduction**\nFactories and farms produced more than people could buy, leading to falling prices and business failures.\n\n**Wealth Inequality**\nThe prosperity of the 1920s wasn't evenly distributed\u2014most gains went to the wealthy, leaving average consumers without enough purchasing power to sustain the economy.\n\n**International Gold Standard**\nCountries tied to gold couldn't flexibly adjust their money supplies, spreading economic problems globally.\n\nIt was really a perfect storm of factors that reinforced each other, turning a recession into the worst economic crisis in modern history.", "timestamp": 1770754281.7466705}
