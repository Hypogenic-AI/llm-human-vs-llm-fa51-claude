Here\u2019s how it happens, simply:\n\n1. **Splitting Atoms:** In a nuclear power plant, atoms (usually uranium) are split apart in a process called **fission**.\n2. **Releasing Heat:** This splitting releases a lot of heat.\n3. **Making Steam:** The heat boils water to make steam.\n4. **Turning a Turbine:** The steam spins a turbine, which is like a big fan.\n5. **Generating Electricity:** The spinning turbine turns a generator, making electricity.\n\nSo, nuclear energy is all about splitting atoms to make heat, which is then turned into electricity!", "timestamp": 1770753551.3425949}
