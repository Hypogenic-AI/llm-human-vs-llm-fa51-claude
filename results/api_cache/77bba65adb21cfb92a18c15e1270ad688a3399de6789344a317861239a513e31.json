He performed under the stage name **David Seville** (which also became the name of the Chipmunks' human caretaker in the franchise).\n\nBagdasarian created the distinctive high-pitched Chipmunk sound by recording his own voice at normal speed, then playing it back at a higher speed. The original three Chipmunks\u2014Alvin, Simon, and Theodore\u2014were actually named after executives at his record label: Alvin Bennett, Simon Waronker, and Theodore Keep.\n\nHis first Chipmunks song, \"The Chipmunk Song (Christmas Don't Be Late),\" became a huge hit in 1958. After his death in 1972, his son Ross Bagdasarian Jr. continued the franchise.", "timestamp": 1770750490.3574283}
