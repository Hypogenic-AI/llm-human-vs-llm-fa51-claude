He is known for playing in the NHL (National Hockey League), not MLB (Major League Baseball). The term \"walkoff homer\" refers to a \"walk-off home run,\" which is a baseball term describing a game-ending home run. It would not make sense to use this phrase in the context of an ice hockey player.\n\n**Summary:** The sentence is implausible because it mixes a hockey player with a baseball event.", "timestamp": 1770751936.9582691}
