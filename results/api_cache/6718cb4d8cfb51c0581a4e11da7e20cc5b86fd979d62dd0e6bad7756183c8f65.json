I would appreciate a clear and concise answer."}], "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 200, "response": "# Answer\n\nThe series you're referring to is **\"Wild Palms\"** (1993).\n\nHowever, I need to make an important correction: **Wild Palms starred James Belushi's brother, Jim Belushi**, not James Belushi (they are the same person - Jim is short for James, so this may be the source of confusion).\n\n**Wild Palms** was a science fiction miniseries that aired on ABC in 1993. It was indeed based on a comic strip by Bruce Wagner that originally appeared in Details magazine. The show was produced by Oliver Stone and explored themes of virtual reality, politics, and conspiracy in a near-future Los Angeles.\n\nJim Belushi played one of the lead roles in this cyberpunk-influenced series, which has since become a cult classic despite its brief run.", "timestamp": 1770750725.572748}
