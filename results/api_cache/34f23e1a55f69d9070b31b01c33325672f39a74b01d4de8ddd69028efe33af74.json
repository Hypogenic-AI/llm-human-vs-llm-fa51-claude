At its essence, AI enables machines to perform tasks that typically require human cognitive functions, such as learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, language understanding, and decision-making.\n\n## Historical Context\n\nAI as a formal discipline emerged in 1956 at the Dartmouth Conference, where pioneers like John McCarthy, Marvin Minsky, and others coined the term. The field has experienced several cycles of optimism and setbacks (known as \"AI winters\") before reaching today's renaissance, driven by increased computational power, big data, and algorithmic breakthroughs.\n\n## Types of AI\n\n### By Capability Level:\n\n**1. Narrow AI (Weak AI)**\n- Designed for specific tasks\n- Currently the only type that exists\n- Examples: voice assistants, recommendation systems, facial recognition\n\n**2. General AI (Strong AI)**\n- Hypothetical AI with human-like intelligence across all domains\n- Can understand, learn, and apply knowledge broadly\n- Does not yet exist\n\n**3. Superintelligent AI**\n- Theoretical AI surpassing human intelligence\n- Subject of philosophical and ethical debate\n- Remains speculative\n\n### By Functionality:\n\n**1. Reactive Machines**\n- No memory; responds to current inputs\n- Example: IBM's Deep Blue chess computer\n\n**2. Limited Memory**\n- Uses past experiences to inform decisions\n- Example: Self-driving cars\n\n**3. Theory of Mind**\n- Understanding emotions and social intelligence (developmental stage)\n\n**4. Self-Aware AI**\n- Possesses consciousness (theoretical)\n\n## Key Technologies and Approaches\n\n### Machine Learning (ML)\nThe subset of AI where systems learn from data without explicit programming:\n- **Supervised Learning**: Training with labeled data\n- **Unsupervised Learning**: Finding patterns in unlabeled data\n- **Reinforcement Learning**: Learning through trial and error with rewards\n\n### Deep Learning\nA specialized form of machine learning using neural networks with multiple layers, particularly effective for:\n- Image and speech recognition\n- Natural language processing\n- Complex pattern recognition\n\n### Natural Language Processing (NLP)", "timestamp": 1770754441.0810401}
