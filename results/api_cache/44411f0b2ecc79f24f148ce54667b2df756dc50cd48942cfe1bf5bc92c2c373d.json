Attention is key here; you remember things better when you focus.\n\n## 2. **Storage** (Keeping it)\nMemories are stored in different areas:\n- **Short-term memory**: Holds info briefly (like a phone number you just heard)\n- **Long-term memory**: Stores info for years (like your childhood home)\n\nThe **hippocampus** acts like a \"save button,\" helping transfer important memories from short to long-term storage.\n\n## 3. **Retrieval** (Recalling it)\nYour brain searches for and pulls up stored memories when needed\u2014like searching for a file. Sometimes memories are easy to find, sometimes they're \"on the tip of your tongue.\"\n\n## The Physical Side\nMemories form when brain cells (neurons) create connections. The more you repeat something, the stronger these connections become\u2014which is why practice helps you remember.\n\n**Bottom line**: Your brain is constantly recording, filing, and retrieving information, with stronger or more emotional experiences creating deeper memories.", "timestamp": 1770754448.6914742}
