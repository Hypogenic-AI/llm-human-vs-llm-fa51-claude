Roger Waters was a founding member who served as bassist and became the primary lyricist and creative force behind many of their concept albums. David Gilmour (note: spelled \"Gilmour\" rather than \"Gilmore\") joined the band in 1967 as guitarist and vocalist, eventually becoming the band's leader after Waters departed in 1985.\n\nTogether, they were instrumental in creating some of Pink Floyd's most iconic albums, including *The Dark Side of the Moon* (1973), *Wish You Were Here* (1975), *Animals* (1977), and *The Wall* (1979).", "timestamp": 1770750692.7401347}
