Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg placed a briefcase containing a bomb in a conference room where Hitler was meeting with military officers. The bomb exploded, but Hitler survived with relatively minor injuries. The plot's failure led to the execution of Stauffenberg and many other conspirators involved in the resistance against the Nazi regime.", "timestamp": 1770755291.999279}
