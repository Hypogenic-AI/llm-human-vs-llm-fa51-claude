Here's what it does:\n\n## Basic Function\nIt follows a simple cycle over and over, billions of times per second:\n\n1. **Fetch** - Grab an instruction from memory\n2. **Decode** - Figure out what the instruction means\n3. **Execute** - Do what the instruction says\n4. **Store** - Save the result\n\n## What It Actually Does\n- Performs basic math (add, subtract, multiply, divide)\n- Moves data around (from memory to different locations)\n- Makes simple decisions (if X is true, do Y)\n- Controls other computer parts\n\n## Key Parts\n- **ALU** (Arithmetic Logic Unit) - does the math\n- **Registers** - tiny, super-fast memory slots for immediate work\n- **Control Unit** - directs traffic and coordinates everything\n\n## The Magic\nEverything complex your computer does\u2014games, videos, web browsing\u2014breaks down into millions of these tiny, simple operations happening incredibly fast. A modern processor can do billions of operations per second.\n\nThink of it like a super-fast calculator that follows a recipe (your program) one step at a time, just *really, really* quickly.", "timestamp": 1770753943.3264112}
