The term \"CRISPR\" stands for **Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats**. It refers to a natural system that bacteria use to defend themselves against viruses.\n\n**How does it work?**\n- Scientists use a protein called **Cas9** (or similar enzymes) that acts like molecular scissors.\n- They design a small piece of RNA (called a \"guide RNA\") that matches the specific DNA sequence they want to edit.\n- The guide RNA leads Cas9 to the exact spot in the DNA.\n- Cas9 cuts the DNA at that spot.\n- The cell then tries to repair the cut, and during this process, scientists can add, remove, or change pieces of DNA.\n\n**Why is it important?**\n- CRISPR is much faster, cheaper, and more accurate than older gene-editing methods.\n- It has huge potential in medicine (like treating genetic diseases), agriculture (creating better crops), and research.\n\n**In summary:**  \nCRISPR gene editing is a revolutionary technology that allows scientists to precisely alter DNA, opening up new possibilities in science, medicine, and beyond.", "timestamp": 1770753504.507829}
