Earthquakes happen when there is a sudden release of energy in the Earth\u2019s crust, causing the ground to shake.\n\nHere\u2019s how it works:\n\n1. **Tectonic Plates:** The Earth\u2019s outer layer (crust) is made up of large pieces called tectonic plates. These plates are always moving, but very slowly.\n\n2. **Stress Builds Up:** Sometimes, the edges of these plates get stuck against each other because of friction, even though the rest of the plate keeps moving. This causes stress to build up at the edges.\n\n3. **Release of Energy:** Eventually, the stress becomes too much, and the plates suddenly slip or move. This movement releases a lot of energy in the form of seismic waves.\n\n4. **Shaking:** The seismic waves travel through the Earth, making the ground shake. This is what we feel as an earthquake.\n\n**In summary:**  \nEarthquakes occur when built-up stress between tectonic plates is suddenly released, causing the ground to shake.", "timestamp": 1770753450.9060829}
