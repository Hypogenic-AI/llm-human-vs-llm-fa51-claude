This natural process is essential for sustaining life, regulating climate, and shaping the planet\u2019s surface. The water cycle involves several key processes that transfer water between the atmosphere, land, and bodies of water.\n\n---\n\n### **Key Processes of the Water Cycle**\n\n1. **Evaporation**\n   - **Definition:** The process by which water changes from a liquid to a gas (water vapor) due to heat from the sun.\n   - **Where it occurs:** Mainly from oceans, lakes, rivers, and other bodies of water.\n   - **Importance:** Evaporation is the primary pathway that water moves from the liquid state back into the atmosphere.\n\n2. **Transpiration**\n   - **Definition:** The release of water vapor from plants and trees into the atmosphere.\n   - **Process:** Plants absorb water from the soil, which moves through the plant and evaporates from the leaves.\n   - **Combined with evaporation:** Together, evaporation and transpiration are called **evapotranspiration**.\n\n3. **Condensation**\n   - **Definition:** The process by which water vapor in the air cools and changes back into liquid droplets, forming clouds.\n   - **How it happens:** As warm, moist air rises, it cools, and the water vapor condenses around tiny particles in the air.\n\n4. **Precipitation**\n   - **Definition:** When water droplets in clouds become too heavy, they fall back to Earth as precipitation.\n   - **Forms:** Rain, snow, sleet, or hail.\n   - **Role:** Precipitation replenishes water in rivers, lakes, oceans, and on land.\n\n5. **Collection (Accumulation)**\n   - **Definition:** The process by which precipitation gathers in bodies of water like rivers, lakes, oceans, and in the ground as groundwater.\n   - **Surface runoff:** Water flows over the land and collects in streams, rivers, and eventually the ocean.\n   - **Infiltration:** Some water soaks into the ground, replenishing groundwater supplies.\n\n---\n\n### **The Cycle in Motion**\n\nThe water cycle is a **closed system**, meaning the total amount of water on Earth remains constant, but it is continuously moving and changing states (liquid, vapor, solid).
