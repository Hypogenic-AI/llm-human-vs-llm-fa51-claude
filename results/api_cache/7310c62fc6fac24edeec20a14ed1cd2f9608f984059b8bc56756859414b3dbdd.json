They work by targeting things that bacteria need to survive:\n\n## Main ways they attack bacteria:\n\n1. **Breaking cell walls** - Bacteria have protective outer walls. Some antibiotics punch holes in them, causing bacteria to burst.\n\n2. **Blocking protein production** - Bacteria need proteins to function. Some antibiotics stop them from making proteins.\n\n3. **Interfering with DNA** - Some antibiotics prevent bacteria from copying their DNA, so they can't reproduce.\n\n4. **Disrupting essential processes** - Some block bacteria from making nutrients they need to survive.\n\n## Important points:\n\n- **Only work on bacteria** - They don't kill viruses (like colds or flu)\n- **Don't harm your cells** - They target structures or processes that human cells don't have\n- **Finish the full course** - Even if you feel better, complete the prescription to kill all the bacteria\n\nThat's the basics!", "timestamp": 1770754010.2713058}
