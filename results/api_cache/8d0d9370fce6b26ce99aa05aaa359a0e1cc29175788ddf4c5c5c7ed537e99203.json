Here is a comprehensive and well-organized explanation of **dark matter**:\n\n---\n\n## What is Dark Matter?\n\n**Dark matter** is a form of matter that does not emit, absorb, or reflect light, making it invisible to current telescopes and undetectable by electromagnetic radiation. Despite being unseen, dark matter is believed to make up about **27% of the universe\u2019s total mass and energy**. Its existence is inferred from its gravitational effects on visible matter, radiation, and the large-scale structure of the universe.\n\n---\n\n## Fundamental Concepts\n\n### 1. **Evidence for Dark Matter**\n\nThe concept of dark matter arises from several key astronomical observations:\n\n- **Galaxy Rotation Curves:** Stars in galaxies orbit at speeds that cannot be explained by the visible mass alone. The outer regions of galaxies rotate much faster than expected, suggesting the presence of additional, unseen mass.\n- **Gravitational Lensing:** Light from distant objects is bent more than can be accounted for by visible matter, indicating extra mass is present.\n- **Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB):** Measurements of the CMB, the afterglow of the Big Bang, show patterns that require more matter than what is visible.\n- **Large-Scale Structure Formation:** The way galaxies and clusters of galaxies are distributed and formed over time suggests the influence of a significant amount of unseen matter.\n\n### 2. **Properties of Dark Matter**\n\n- **Invisible:** Does not interact with electromagnetic forces, so it cannot be seen directly.\n- **Massive:** Exerts gravitational influence, affecting the motion of stars, galaxies, and light.\n- **Non-baryonic:** Most dark matter is thought not to be made of protons, neutrons, and electrons (the building blocks of ordinary matter).\n- **Weakly Interacting:** Interacts very little with itself and with ordinary matter, except through gravity.\n\n---\n\n## What is Dark Matter Made Of?\n\nThe exact nature of dark matter is still unknown. Several candidates have been proposed:\n\n- **WIMPs (Weakly Interacting Massive Particles):** Hypothetical particles that interact via gravity and possibly the weak nuclear force.\n- **Axions:** Extremely light, hypothetical particles that could also account for dark matter.\n- **Sterile Neutrinos:** A type of neutrino that does not interact via the weak force.\n- **MACHOs (Massive Astrophysical Compact Halo Objects):** Objects like black holes, neutron stars, or", "timestamp": 1770753825.5671096}
