This transformation is particularly significant because, as the Bellman warns the crew:\n\n> \"But if ever you meet with a Boojum, you will softly and suddenly vanish away, and never be met with again!\"\n\nSo, the Snark can **turn into a Boojum** to fool the hunters, and encountering a Boojum is extremely dangerous, as it causes the hunter to vanish without a trace. This twist is revealed at the end of the poem, when the Baker finds a Snark, but it turns out to be a Boojum, and he vanishes \"softly and suddenly.\"", "timestamp": 1770750274.1700647}
