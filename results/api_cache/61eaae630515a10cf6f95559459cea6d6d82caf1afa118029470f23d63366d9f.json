Here's the breakdown:\n\n## The Basic Concept\n\n**Trilateration** - Your GPS receiver calculates its position by measuring distances to multiple satellites, then finding where those distances intersect.\n\n## The Key Components\n\n1. **Satellites** (24-32 orbiting Earth)\n   - Circle the planet twice daily at ~12,500 miles up\n   - Each constantly broadcasts its location and precise time\n\n2. **Your GPS Receiver** (phone, car, etc.)\n   - Listens to satellite signals\n   - Calculates distances and position\n\n3. **Ground Stations**\n   - Monitor satellites and keep them accurate\n\n## How It Calculates Your Position\n\n1. **Timing is everything**: Each satellite sends a signal with a timestamp. Your receiver notes when it arrives.\n\n2. **Distance calculation**: Since radio waves travel at light speed, the receiver calculates: \n   - *Distance = Speed of light \u00d7 Time delay*\n\n3. **Drawing spheres**: Each satellite distance creates an imaginary sphere around that satellite where you could be located.\n\n4. **Finding the intersection**:\n   - 1 satellite = you're somewhere on a huge sphere\n   - 2 satellites = you're on a circle where spheres intersect\n   - 3 satellites = narrows it to 2 points\n   - **4 satellites = pinpoints your exact 3D location** (and corrects clock errors)\n\n## Why It's So Accurate\n\n- Atomic clocks on satellites (accurate to nanoseconds)\n- Error corrections from ground stations\n- Modern receivers use signals from multiple satellite systems (GPS, GLONASS, Galileo)\n\nPretty clever, right?", "timestamp": 1770754049.7596567}
