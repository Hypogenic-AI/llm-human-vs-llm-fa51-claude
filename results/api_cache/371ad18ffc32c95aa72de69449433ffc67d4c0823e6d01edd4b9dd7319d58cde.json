He even briefly taught geometry at a preparatory school in Connecticut.\n\nHowever, he didn't ultimately pursue teaching as a career because his music partnership with Paul Simon (as Simon & Garfunkel) took off during this period, leading to massive success with albums like \"Sounds of Silence\" and \"Bridge Over Troubled Water.\"\n\nSo while he did qualify academically, he chose not to continue in the teaching profession due to his musical success.", "timestamp": 1770750813.042954}
