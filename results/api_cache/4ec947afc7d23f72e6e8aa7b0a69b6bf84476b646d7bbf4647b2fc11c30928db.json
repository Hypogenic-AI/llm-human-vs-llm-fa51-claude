In soccer, players don't catch passes with their hands (except for goalkeepers), and the term \"screen pass\" isn't used in that sport.\n\nA plausible sentence would be something like \"Edinson Cavani scored a header\" or for American football, \"Travis Kelce caught the screen pass.\"", "timestamp": 1770752369.6483898}
