It is a complex system that involves the circulation of water in its three states\u2014liquid, solid (ice), and gas (water vapor)\u2014through various reservoirs including oceans, atmosphere, land, rivers, lakes, and living organisms.\n\n## Fundamental Concepts\n\n### Why the Water Cycle Matters\n- **Sustains life**: Provides fresh water essential for all living organisms\n- **Regulates climate**: Distributes heat around the planet\n- **Shapes landscapes**: Drives erosion and geological processes\n- **Renewable resource**: The same water has been recycling for billions of years\n\n### Energy Source\nThe sun is the primary driver of the water cycle, providing energy that causes water to change states and move through the system.\n\n## Key Stages of the Water Cycle\n\n### 1. **Evaporation**\n- Water transforms from liquid to gas (water vapor)\n- Occurs primarily from oceans, lakes, rivers, and other water bodies\n- Heat from the sun provides energy for molecules to escape the water surface\n- Accounts for approximately 90% of atmospheric moisture\n\n### 2. **Transpiration**\n- Water vapor released from plants through tiny pores (stomata) in leaves\n- Plants absorb water through roots and release it through leaves\n- Combined with evaporation, this process is called **evapotranspiration**\n- Contributes about 10% of atmospheric moisture\n\n### 3. **Sublimation**\n- Direct conversion of ice and snow to water vapor without melting\n- Occurs in cold, dry conditions\n- Common in polar regions and high mountains\n- A minor but important component of the cycle\n\n### 4. **Condensation**\n- Water vapor cools and transforms back into liquid droplets\n- Forms clouds, fog, and dew\n- Occurs when air rises, expands, and cools\n- Tiny water droplets form around dust particles and other aerosols (condensation nuclei)\n\n### 5. **Precipitation**\n- Water falls from clouds to Earth's surface\n- Forms include:\n  - **Rain**:", "timestamp": 1770754473.726471}
