It refers to a specific type of short forward pass thrown behind the line of scrimmage.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nUnless you are writing a fictional or humorous scenario where Cavani is playing American football, the sentence is not plausible. In real life, Cavani would not be involved in a play involving a \"screen pass.\"", "timestamp": 1770751987.9229696}
