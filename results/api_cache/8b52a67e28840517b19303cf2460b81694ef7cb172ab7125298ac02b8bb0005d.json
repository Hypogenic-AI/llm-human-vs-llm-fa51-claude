Here\u2019s a simple explanation of how black holes form:\n\n**1. Stars and Gravity:**  \nStars are huge balls of gas, mostly hydrogen, held together by gravity. In their cores, nuclear fusion creates energy, which pushes outward and balances the force of gravity pulling inward.\n\n**2. Running Out of Fuel:**  \nEventually, a massive star (much bigger than our Sun) runs out of fuel for fusion. Without this energy, the outward pressure drops.\n\n**3. Collapse:**  \nGravity takes over and the core of the star collapses in on itself. For very massive stars, this collapse is so intense that the core gets squeezed into an incredibly small, dense point.\n\n**4. Black Hole is Born:**  \nIf the core\u2019s mass is large enough (about three times the mass of the Sun or more), nothing can stop the collapse. The core becomes a black hole\u2014a region where gravity is so strong that not even light can escape.\n\n**In summary:**  \nBlack holes form when very massive stars die, their cores collapse under gravity, and the resulting object is so dense and has such strong gravity that nothing, not even light, can escape from it.\n\nLet me know if you want more details or have other questions!", "timestamp": 1770753519.3567011}
