Here\u2019s a simple explanation of how solar panels work:\n\n1. **Sunlight Hits the Panel:**  \nSolar panels are made up of many smaller units called solar cells, usually made from silicon. When sunlight shines on these cells, it brings energy in the form of tiny particles called photons.\n\n2. **Creating Electricity:**  \nThe energy from the photons knocks electrons loose from the atoms in the silicon. This movement of electrons creates an electric current.\n\n3. **Direct Current (DC):**  \nThe electricity generated by the solar cells is called direct current (DC). However, most homes and appliances use alternating current (AC).\n\n4. **Inverter Converts DC to AC:**  \nA device called an inverter changes the DC electricity into AC electricity, which can then be used to power your home or sent back to the electric grid.\n\n**In summary:**  \nSolar panels turn sunlight into electricity by using the energy from the sun to move electrons in silicon cells, creating a flow of electricity that can power your home.\n\nLet me know if you want a more detailed or technical explanation!", "timestamp": 1770753737.4076624}
