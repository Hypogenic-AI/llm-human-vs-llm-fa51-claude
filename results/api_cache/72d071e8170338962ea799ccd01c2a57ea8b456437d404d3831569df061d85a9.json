However, at the end of the poem, it's revealed that the particular Snark they found was a **Boojum**.\n\nThe poem famously warns: \"For the Snark was a Boojum, you see.\"\n\nWhen the Baker finally encounters the Snark and discovers it's a Boojum, he \"softly and suddenly vanished away.\" A Boojum is a particularly dangerous variety of Snark, not something the Snark transforms into as a disguise. The danger of encountering a Boojum rather than an ordinary Snark is foreshadowed throughout the poem.", "timestamp": 1770750776.445556}
