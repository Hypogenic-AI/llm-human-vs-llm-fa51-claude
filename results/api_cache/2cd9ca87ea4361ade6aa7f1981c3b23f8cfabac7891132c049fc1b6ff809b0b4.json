Fundamental Concepts\n\n### What is an Earthquake?\nAn earthquake is the shaking of the Earth's surface resulting from a sudden release of energy in the Earth's lithosphere. This energy creates seismic waves that propagate through the Earth's layers, causing the ground motion we experience.\n\n### The Earth's Structure (Relevant Layers)\n- **Crust**: The outermost solid layer (5-70 km thick)\n- **Mantle**: Semi-solid layer beneath the crust\n- **Lithosphere**: Rigid outer layer including crust and upper mantle\n- **Asthenosphere**: Partially molten layer where tectonic plates move\n\n## 2. The Mechanism: Elastic Rebound Theory\n\n### The Process\n1. **Stress Accumulation**: Tectonic forces apply stress to rocks along fault lines\n2. **Elastic Deformation**: Rocks bend and deform elastically, storing energy (like stretching a rubber band)\n3. **Exceeding Strength**: When stress exceeds the rock's strength, it fractures\n4. **Sudden Release**: The stored energy releases instantaneously\n5. **Rebound**: Rocks snap back to their original shape, generating seismic waves\n\n## 3. Tectonic Plate Boundaries\n\n### Convergent Boundaries (Collision Zones)\n- Plates move toward each other\n- Creates the most powerful earthquakes\n- **Example**: Pacific Ring of Fire, where oceanic plates subduct beneath continental plates\n- Can produce earthquakes at depths up to 700 km\n\n### Divergent Boundaries (Spreading Zones)\n- Plates move apart\n- Generally produces smaller, shallower earthquakes\n- **Example**: Mid-Atlantic Ridge\n- Associated with volcanic activity\n\n### Transform Boundaries (Sliding Zones)\n- Plates slide horizontally past each other\n- Produces frequent, sometimes powerful earthquakes\n- **Example**: San Andreas Fault in California\n- Typically shallow earthquakes (0-20 km deep)\n\n## 4. Types of Faults\n\n### Strike-Slip Faults\n- Horizontal movement\n- Blocks slide past each", "timestamp": 1770754202.8278975}
