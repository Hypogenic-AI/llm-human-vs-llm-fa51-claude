A \"walkoff homer\" (home run) is a baseball term for a game-ending home run hit in the bottom of the final inning.\n\nThe sentence mixes sports - it's like saying \"Tom Brady scored a touchdown\" but in reverse. While technically Kevin Durant *could* hit a baseball in some casual context, the sentence implies a professional game scenario, which doesn't make sense given his sport.", "timestamp": 1770752429.503591}
