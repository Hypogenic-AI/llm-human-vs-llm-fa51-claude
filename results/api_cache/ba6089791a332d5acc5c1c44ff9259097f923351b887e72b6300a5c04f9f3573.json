Understanding its causes requires examining both long-term structural issues and short-term triggers.\n\n## Long-Term Causes\n\n### 1. **Alliance Systems**\nBy 1914, Europe was divided into two major alliance blocs:\n- **Triple Alliance**: Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Italy\n- **Triple Entente**: France, Russia, and Britain\n\nThese alliances were meant to provide security but created a dangerous situation where a conflict between two nations could quickly involve all major powers.\n\n### 2. **Militarism**\n- European powers engaged in an arms race, particularly in naval power (Britain vs. Germany)\n- Military spending increased dramatically in the early 20th century\n- Military leaders gained significant political influence\n- War plans (like Germany's Schlieffen Plan) were rigid and assumed offensive action\n\n### 3. **Imperialism**\n- Competition for colonies created tensions, particularly in Africa and Asia\n- The \"Scramble for Africa\" left Germany feeling it deserved more territory\n- Imperial rivalries bred mutual suspicion and hostility\n- Colonial disputes brought European powers into conflict worldwide\n\n### 4. **Nationalism**\n- Intense national pride and competition between powers\n- **Pan-Slavism**: Russia's support for Slavic peoples threatened Austria-Hungary\n- **Ethnic tensions**: Particularly acute in Austria-Hungary's multi-ethnic empire\n- **Revanchism**: French desire to reclaim Alsace-Lorraine from Germany\n\n### 5. **Economic Rivalry**\n- Germany's rapid industrialization challenged Britain's economic dominance\n- Trade competition increased tensions between powers\n- Economic interests often aligned with imperial ambitions\n\n## Short-Term Triggers\n\n### **The July Crisis (1914)**\n\n**June 28, 1914**: Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand\n- Heir to Austria-Hungary's throne killed in Sarajevo by Gavrilo Princip\n- Princip was a Bosnian Serb nationalist with links to Serbian military intelligence\n- Austria-Hungary saw this as an opportunity to crush Serbian nationalism\n\n**The Chain Reaction:**\n\n1.", "timestamp": 1770753935.4097714}
