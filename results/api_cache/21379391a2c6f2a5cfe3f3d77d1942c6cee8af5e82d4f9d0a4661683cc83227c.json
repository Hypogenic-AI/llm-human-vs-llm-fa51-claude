Adam Thielen is a professional American football player, known for playing as a wide receiver in the NFL, not a baseball player. Therefore, it is not plausible in a literal or typical sports context to say \"Adam Thielen got on base.\" The statement would only make sense if he were playing baseball, which is not what he is known for.", "timestamp": 1770751897.2361863}
