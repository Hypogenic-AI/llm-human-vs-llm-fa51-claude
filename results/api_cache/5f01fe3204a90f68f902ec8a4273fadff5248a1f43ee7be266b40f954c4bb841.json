A \"through ball\" is a pass played between or beyond defenders into space for a teammate to run onto. \"Getting on the end of\" a through ball means successfully reaching the ball, typically to create a scoring opportunity.\n\n3. **Is this action plausible for Marcelo?** Yes, absolutely. Even though Marcelo is primarily a defender, he is known for his attacking runs and offensive contributions. Defenders regularly make forward runs and can receive through balls, especially in modern football where full-backs often join attacks.\n\n4", "timestamp": 1770752070.1363325}
