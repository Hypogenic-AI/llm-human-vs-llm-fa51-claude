It's one of the most important biological processes on Earth, providing the foundation for most food chains and producing the oxygen we breathe.\n\n## The Basic Equation\n\nThe overall process can be summarized as:\n\n**6CO\u2082 + 6H\u2082O + light energy \u2192 C\u2086H\u2081\u2082O\u2086 + 6O\u2082**\n\n(Carbon dioxide + water + light \u2192 glucose + oxygen)\n\n## The Two Main Stages\n\n### 1. **Light-Dependent Reactions (Light Reactions)**\n\nThese occur in the **thylakoid membranes** of chloroplasts:\n\n- **Photon absorption**: Chlorophyll and other pigments in Photosystem II absorb light energy\n- **Water splitting**: Light energy splits water molecules (photolysis), releasing oxygen as a byproduct\n- **Electron transport**: Energized electrons move through an electron transport chain\n- **ATP production**: This electron flow powers the creation of ATP (energy currency)\n- **NADPH formation**: Photosystem I produces NADPH, an electron carrier\n\n**Products**: ATP, NADPH, and O\u2082\n\n### 2. **Light-Independent Reactions (Calvin Cycle)**\n\nThese occur in the **stroma** of chloroplasts:\n\n- **Carbon fixation**: CO\u2082 is captured and attached to a 5-carbon molecule (RuBP) by the enzyme RuBisCO\n- **Reduction**: Using ATP and NADPH from the light reactions, 3-carbon molecules are converted into G3P (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate)\n- **Regeneration**: Some G3P molecules regenerate RuBP to continue the cycle\n- **Glucose synthesis**: Some G3P molecules are used to build glucose and other carbohydrates\n\n## Key Components\n\n- **Chloroplasts**: The organelles where photosynthesis occurs\n- **Chlorophyll**: The green pigment that absorbs light (primarily red and blue wavelengths)\n- **Thylakoids**:", "timestamp": 1770753880.1448991}
