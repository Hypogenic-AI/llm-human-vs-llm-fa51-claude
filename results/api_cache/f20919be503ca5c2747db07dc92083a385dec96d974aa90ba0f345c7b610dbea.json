Leaves absorb sunlight using chlorophyll (the green pigment)\n2. This energy converts water + CO\u2082 into glucose (sugar)\n3. Oxygen is released as a byproduct\n\n**Simple equation:**\n```\nSunlight + Water + CO\u2082 \u2192 Glucose + Oxygen\n```\n\n**The result:**\n- Plants get food (glucose) to grow\n- We get oxygen to breathe\n\nThink of it like solar-powered cooking\u2014plants use sun energy to \"cook up\" their food!", "timestamp": 1770753871.7647789}
