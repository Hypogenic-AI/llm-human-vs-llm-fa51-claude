In American football, referees throw a flag to indicate a penalty on a play.\n- In soccer, referees do not \"flag\" players for infractions; instead, they show yellow or red cards, or assistant referees raise a flag for offside or out-of-bounds, but the phrase \"flagged on the play\" is not used.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe sentence is not plausible because it mixes an American football term", "timestamp": 1770751826.8968356}
