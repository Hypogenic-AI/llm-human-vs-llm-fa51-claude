Here's the journey:\n\n## 1. **Mouth** (Start)\n- You chew food into smaller pieces\n- Saliva mixes in, starting to break down starches\n- Your tongue forms food into a ball (bolus) to swallow\n\n## 2. **Esophagus** (The Transport Tube)\n- Muscular contractions (peristalsis) push food down to your stomach\n- Takes about 2-3 seconds\n\n## 3. **Stomach** (The Mixer)\n- Churns food for 2-6 hours\n- Stomach acid and enzymes break down proteins\n- Turns food into a thick liquid called chyme\n\n## 4. **Small Intestine** (Main Absorption Site)\n- **Most important part** - about 20 feet long!\n- Receives help from:\n  - **Pancreas**: sends digestive enzymes\n  - **Liver/Gallbladder**: sends bile to break down fats\n- Nutrients absorb through intestinal walls into your bloodstream\n- Takes 3-5 hours\n\n## 5. **Large Intestine/Colon** (Water Recovery)\n- Absorbs water and minerals\n- Bacteria help break down remaining material\n- Forms solid waste (stool)\n\n## 6. **Rectum & Anus** (Exit)\n- Stores and eliminates waste\n\n**Total journey time:** 24-72 hours from eating to elimination!\n\nAny specific part you'd like me to explain more?", "timestamp": 1770754557.3779366}
