Philip Rivers was an NFL quarterback who played from 2004-2020, primarily for the San Diego/Los Angeles Chargers. A \"hail mary\" is a long, desperate pass thrown toward the end zone, typically at the end of a half or game. Since throwing passes was literally Rivers' job as a quarterback, it's entirely plausible that he would have launched a hail mary at some point during his career.", "timestamp": 1770752412.827209}
