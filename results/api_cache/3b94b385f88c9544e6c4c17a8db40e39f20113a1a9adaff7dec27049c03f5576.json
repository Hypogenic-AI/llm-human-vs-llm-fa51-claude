Here is a comprehensive explanation of the causes of **inflation**, structured to cover the key aspects of the topic:\n\n---\n\n## **What is Inflation?**\n\n**Inflation** is the sustained increase in the general price level of goods and services in an economy over a period of time. When inflation occurs, each unit of currency buys fewer goods and services, reflecting a decrease in the purchasing power of money.\n\n---\n\n## **Main Causes of Inflation**\n\nEconomists generally classify the causes of inflation into several broad categories:\n\n### 1. **Demand-Pull Inflation**\n\n**Definition:**  \nOccurs when aggregate demand in an economy outpaces aggregate supply.\n\n**Causes:**  \n- **Economic Growth:** When consumers and businesses are confident, they spend more, increasing demand.\n- **Government Spending:** Increased government expenditure (e.g., on infrastructure) can boost demand.\n- **Monetary Expansion:** Lower interest rates or increased money supply make borrowing cheaper, encouraging spending.\n- **Exports:** A surge in demand for a country\u2019s exports can increase overall demand.\n\n**Result:**  \nToo much money chasing too few goods leads to higher prices.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Cost-Push Inflation**\n\n**Definition:**  \nOccurs when the costs of production increase, leading firms to raise prices to maintain profit margins.\n\n**Causes:**  \n- **Wage Increases:** Higher wages raise production costs.\n- **Raw Material Prices:** Increases in the price of key inputs (e.g., oil, metals) make production more expensive.\n- **Supply Shocks:** Natural disasters, geopolitical events, or pandemics can disrupt supply chains, raising costs.\n- **Exchange Rate Depreciation:** A weaker currency makes imported goods and inputs more expensive.\n\n**Result:**  \nHigher production costs are passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Built-In (Wage-Price Spiral) Inflation**\n\n**Definition:**  \nInflation that results from a feedback loop between wages and prices.\n\n**Process:**  \n- Workers demand higher wages to keep up with rising living costs.\n- Businesses, facing higher wage bills, increase prices to maintain profits.\n- Higher prices lead to further wage demands, and the cycle continues.\n\n**Result:**  \nA self-perpetuating cycle of rising wages and prices.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Monetary Inflation**\n\n**Definition:**  \nInflation caused by an increase in the money supply.\n\n**Causes:**  \n- **Central Bank Policies:** Printing", "timestamp": 1770753793.3005397}
