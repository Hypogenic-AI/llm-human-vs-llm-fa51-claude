DJ Chark has played for the Jacksonville Jaguars (AFC) and later the Detroit Lions (NFC). However, for him to catch a pass in the NFC divisional round, his team would need to make the playoffs. The Lions did make the playoffs in the 2023 season, so this is technically possible.\n\n**Verdict: Plausible**", "timestamp": 1770752379.4288714}
