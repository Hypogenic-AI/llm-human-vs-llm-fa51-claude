The phrase \"two imposters\" comes from Rudyard Kipling\u2019s famous poem **\"If\u2014\"**. In the poem, Kipling advises his son to:\n\n> \"meet with Triumph and Disaster  \n> And treat those two impostors just the same;\"\n\n**The \"two imposters\" are \"Triumph\" and \"Disaster\".** Kipling personifies these as imposters, suggesting that both success (triumph) and failure (disaster) are fleeting and deceptive. He counsels that one should respond to both with equanimity, not letting either unduly affect one\u2019s character or actions.\n\n**In summary:**  \nAccording to Rudyard Kipling, the \"two imposters\" are **Triumph and Disaster**, and he advises to \"meet with Triumph and Disaster and treat those two impostors just the same.\"", "timestamp": 1770750437.1429691}
