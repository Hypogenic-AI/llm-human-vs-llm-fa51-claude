What are stocks?**\n- When you buy a stock, you own a small piece of that company\n- If the company does well, your shares typically become more valuable\n- Some companies also pay dividends (cash payments to shareholders)\n\n**2. How buying/selling works:**\n- **Buyers** want stocks they think will increase in value\n- **Sellers** want to cash out their investment\n- Prices change based on supply and demand\u2014if more people want to buy than sell, prices go up (and vice versa)\n\n**3. Stock exchanges:**\n- Physical/digital marketplaces where trading happens (NYSE, NASDAQ, etc.)\n- They match buyers with sellers\n- Trading happens during set hours (usually 9:30 AM - 4 PM ET in the US)\n\n## Why Prices Change\n\nStock prices fluctuate based on:\n- Company performance (profits, new products, leadership)\n- Economic conditions\n- Investor sentiment and expectations\n- News and world events\n\n## The Purpose\n\n- **For companies:** Raise money to grow their business\n- **For investors:** Potentially grow wealth over time\n\nThink of it as a continuous auction where millions of people are voting with their money on what they think companies are worth!", "timestamp": 1770753976.7890475}
