Here\u2019s a simple explanation of **how the digestive system works**:\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Mouth**\n- **Digestion begins here.**\n- You chew food, breaking it into smaller pieces.\n- Saliva (spit) mixes in, starting to break down carbohydrates (like bread and pasta).\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Esophagus**\n- After swallowing, food travels down a tube called the **esophagus**.\n- Muscles push the food down to your stomach.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Stomach**\n- The stomach is like a mixer.\n- It churns food and mixes it with stomach acid and enzymes.\n- This breaks food down into a thick liquid called **chyme**.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Small Intestine**\n- The chyme moves into the **small intestine**.\n- Here, more enzymes (from the pancreas and liver) help break down food even further.\n- **Nutrients** (vitamins, minerals, proteins, fats, sugars) are absorbed through the walls of the small intestine into your blood.\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Large Intestine (Colon)**\n- Anything left over (mostly water and waste) goes into the **large intestine**.\n- Water is absorbed, and the remaining waste becomes more solid.\n\n---\n\n### 6. **Rectum and Anus**\n- The solid waste (poop) is stored in the **rectum** until you go to the bathroom.\n\n---\n\n**In summary:**  \nThe digestive system breaks down food into nutrients your body can use for energy, growth, and repair. What\u2019s left over leaves your body as waste.\n\nLet me know if you want more details about any part!", "timestamp": 1770753834.585973}
