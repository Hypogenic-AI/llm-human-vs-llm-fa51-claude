Brandin Cooks is a wide receiver in the NFL. The decision to \"go for it on fourth down\" is made by the head coach or quarterback, not a wide receiver. Wide receivers run routes and catch passes, but they don't make the strategic decision about whether to attempt a play on fourth down versus punting or kicking a field goal.", "timestamp": 1770752466.8122408}
