World War I, also known as the Great War, began in 1914 and had a complex set of causes. Here are the main factors:\n\n### 1. **Militarism**\nEuropean countries, especially Germany and Britain, were building up their military forces and weapons. This arms race created tension and made war more likely.\n\n### 2. **Alliances**\nEurope was divided into two main alliance systems:\n- **Triple Entente:** France, Russia, and Britain\n- **Triple Alliance:** Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Italy  \nThese alliances meant that if one country was attacked, allied countries were likely to be drawn in.\n\n### 3. **Imperialism**\nEuropean powers were competing for colonies and influence around the world, especially in Africa and Asia. This competition created rivalries and conflicts.\n\n### 4. **Nationalism**\nNationalist feelings were strong in many countries. Some ethnic groups wanted independence (like Serbs in Austria-Hungary), and countries like Germany and France had deep national pride and rivalries.\n\n### 5. **The Spark: Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand**\nThe immediate cause was the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria-Hungary by a Serbian nationalist in Sarajevo on June 28, 1914. Austria-Hungary blamed Serbia and declared war, setting off a chain reaction due to the alliance system.\n\n### **Summary**\nWhile the assassination was the immediate trigger, the underlying causes were militarism, alliances, imperialism, and nationalism. These factors created a situation where a single event could lead to a large-scale war.\n\nLet me know if you want more details on any of these points!", "timestamp": 1770753192.2354019}
