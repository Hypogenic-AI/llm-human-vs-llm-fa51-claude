Superposition**\n- A qubit can exist in multiple states at once\n- Like a coin spinning in the air (both heads and tails) until measured\n\n**2. Entanglement**\n- Qubits can be correlated in ways impossible classically\n- Measuring one instantly affects others, regardless of distance\n\n**3. Interference**\n- Quantum states can amplify correct answers and cancel out wrong ones\n\n## What Makes Them Powerful?\n\nWith each qubit added, processing power roughly **doubles**:\n- 3 qubits = 8 possible states simultaneously\n- 300 qubits = more states than atoms in the universe\n\nThis allows quantum computers to explore many solutions at once.\n\n## Potential Applications\n\n- Breaking encryption\n- Drug discovery\n- Optimizing complex systems\n- Simulating quantum physics\n- AI and machine learning\n\n## Current Limitations\n\n- Extremely fragile (need near absolute zero temperatures)\n- High error rates\n- Only useful for specific problems\n- Still mostly experimental\n\nThink of it as a specialized tool, not a replacement for regular computers!", "timestamp": 1770753994.0813603}
