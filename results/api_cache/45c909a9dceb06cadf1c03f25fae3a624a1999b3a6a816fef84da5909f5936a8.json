The **greenhouse effect** is a natural process that warms the Earth\u2019s surface.\n\nHere\u2019s how it works:\n\n1. **Sunlight reaches Earth:** The Sun emits energy in the form of light and heat. Some of this energy passes through the Earth\u2019s atmosphere and reaches the surface.\n\n2. **Earth absorbs and re-emits energy:** The Earth\u2019s surface absorbs most of this energy and then radiates it back toward space as heat (infrared radiation).\n\n3. **Greenhouse gases trap some heat:** Certain gases in the atmosphere\u2014like carbon dioxide (CO\u2082), methane (CH\u2084), water vapor, and nitrous oxide\u2014act like the glass of a greenhouse. They let sunlight in but trap some of the heat as it tries to escape back into space.\n\n4. **Warming the planet:** By trapping heat, these greenhouse gases keep the Earth\u2019s average temperature at a comfortable level (about 15\u00b0C or 59\u00b0F). Without the greenhouse effect, Earth would be much colder\u2014about -18\u00b0C (0\u00b0F)\u2014and life as we know it wouldn\u2019t be possible.\n\n**Why is it a concern?**  \nHuman activities, like burning fossil fuels and deforestation, are increasing the concentration of greenhouse gases. This enhances the greenhouse effect, leading to global warming and climate change.\n\n**In summary:**  \nThe greenhouse effect is essential for life, but too much of it (from extra greenhouse gases) is causing the planet to heat up more than is natural or safe.", "timestamp": 1770753612.611504}
