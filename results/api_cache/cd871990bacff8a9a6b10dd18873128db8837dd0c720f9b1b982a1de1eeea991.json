There are several main causes of inflation, often grouped into a few broad categories:\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Demand-Pull Inflation**\n- **Definition:** Occurs when demand for goods and services exceeds their supply.\n- **Causes:**\n  - Economic growth leading to higher consumer spending.\n  - Government spending increases.\n  - Lower interest rates making borrowing cheaper.\n  - Increased exports.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Cost-Push Inflation**\n- **Definition:** Happens when the costs of production increase, causing producers to raise prices to maintain profit margins.\n- **Causes:**\n  - Rising wages (labor costs).\n  - Increased prices for raw materials (like oil or metals).\n  - Supply chain disruptions.\n  - Higher taxes or regulations increasing production costs.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Built-In Inflation (Wage-Price Spiral)**\n- **Definition:** When workers demand higher wages to keep up with rising living costs, and businesses pass those higher labor costs onto consumers in the form of higher prices.\n- **Cycle:** Higher prices \u2192 higher wage demands \u2192 higher production costs \u2192 even higher prices.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Monetary Inflation**\n- **Definition:** Caused by an increase in the money supply in the economy.\n- **Causes:**\n  - Central banks printing more money.\n  - Expansionary monetary policy (lower interest rates, quantitative easing).\n- **Effect:** More money chasing the same amount of goods and services leads to price increases.\n\n---\n\n### 5. **External Factors**\n- **Examples:**\n  - Exchange rate depreciation (imported goods become more expensive).\n  - Global commodity price shocks (like oil price spikes).\n  - Natural disasters or geopolitical events disrupting supply.\n\n---\n\n**In summary:**  \nInflation can be caused by increased demand, higher production costs, expectations of future inflation, expansion of the money supply, or external shocks. Often, several of these factors interact to drive inflation in an economy.\n\nLet me know if you want more detail on any specific cause!", "timestamp": 1770753758.673815}
