Blocks**\n- Each \"block\" is like a page in a notebook containing transaction records\n- Example: \"Alice sent Bob $10\"\n\n**2. Chain**\n- Blocks are linked together in chronological order\n- Each new block references the previous one\n\n**3. Decentralized**\n- Instead of one company keeping the records, thousands of computers have identical copies\n- No single person controls it\n\n## How it works:\n\n1. **Someone makes a transaction** \u2192 \"Send $10\"\n2. **Transaction is broadcast** \u2192 Sent to the network\n3. **Network validates it** \u2192 Computers verify you actually have $10\n4. **Added to a block** \u2192 Grouped with other transactions\n5. **Block is added to chain** \u2192 Permanently recorded\n6. **Everyone's copy updates** \u2192 All computers sync\n\n## Why it's secure:\n\n- **Can't change history**: Altering old records would require changing every computer's copy simultaneously\n- **Transparent**: Everyone can verify transactions\n- **No middleman needed**: No bank or company required to verify\n\n**Real-world use**: Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, but also supply chain tracking, medical records, and contracts.", "timestamp": 1770754158.600048}
