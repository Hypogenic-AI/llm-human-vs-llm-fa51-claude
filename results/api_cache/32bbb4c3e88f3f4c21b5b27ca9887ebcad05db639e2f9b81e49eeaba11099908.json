Alliance Systems**\n- Europe divided into two camps: Triple Entente (France, Russia, Britain) vs. Triple Alliance (Germany, Austria-Hungary, Italy)\n- Meant a local conflict could quickly escalate\n\n**2. Militarism**\n- Arms race, especially between Britain and Germany's navies\n- Military planning (like Germany's Schlieffen Plan) that assumed war was inevitable\n\n**3. Imperialism**\n- Competition for colonies created tensions, particularly in Africa and Asia\n- Rivalries over territory and resources\n\n**4. Nationalism**\n- Intense national pride and ethnic tensions\n- Particularly destabilizing in Austria-Hungary's multi-ethnic empire\n- Slavic nationalism (supported by Russia) threatened Austrian control\n\n**5. The July Crisis**\n- Austria-Hungary's ultimatum to Serbia\n- Russia's mobilization to support Serbia\n- Germany's support for Austria\n- The alliance system pulled everyone in within weeks\n\nIt wasn't one single cause but rather these interconnected factors creating a \"powder keg\" that the assassination ignited.", "timestamp": 1770753923.788193}
