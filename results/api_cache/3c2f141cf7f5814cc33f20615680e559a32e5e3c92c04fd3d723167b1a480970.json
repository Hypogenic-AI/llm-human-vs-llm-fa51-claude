The flag of Libya has undergone several changes throughout its history. If you are referring to the flag used from **1977 to 2011**, the flag of Libya was a **plain green rectangle** with no other markings, symbols, or designs. This made it the only national flag in the world at the time to feature just one color and no design or insignia.\n\nHowever, since **2011**, Libya has reverted to its original flag, which consists of three horizontal stripes of red, black (with a white crescent and star), and green.\n\n**In summary:**  \n- **From 1977 to 2011:** The flag of Libya was a plain green rectangle.\n- **Currently (since 2011):** The flag is not a plain rectangle; it has three colors and symbols.\n\nIf your question refers to the period when Libya had a plain rectangle flag, the color is **green**.", "timestamp": 1770750194.6870666}
