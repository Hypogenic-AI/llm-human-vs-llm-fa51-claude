He achieved the chipmunks' distinctive high-pitched voices by recording his own voice at normal speed and then playing it back at a higher speed. The first hit song, \"The Chipmunk Song (Christmas Don't Be Late),\" became a huge success and won three Grammy Awards.", "timestamp": 1770750500.1758652}
