The Great Depression was the most severe and prolonged economic downturn of the 20th century, lasting from 1929 to the late 1930s. Its causes are complex and multifaceted, involving a combination of domestic and international factors. Below is a comprehensive explanation of the key causes of the Great Depression:\n\n---\n\n## 1. **Stock Market Crash of 1929**\n\n- **Speculation and Overvaluation:** Throughout the 1920s, the U.S. stock market experienced a rapid expansion. Many investors speculated wildly, often buying stocks on margin (borrowing money to buy stocks), which inflated stock prices far beyond their real value.\n- **Panic and Collapse:** On October 24, 1929 (\"Black Thursday\"), panic selling began, culminating in the crash on October 29 (\"Black Tuesday\"). Billions of dollars were wiped out, eroding confidence in the economy.\n\n## 2. **Bank Failures and Financial Panic**\n\n- **Bank Runs:** As the stock market collapsed, people rushed to withdraw their savings, fearing bank insolvency. Thousands of banks failed between 1930 and 1933.\n- **Loss of Savings:** Bank failures wiped out the savings of millions, further reducing consumer spending and deepening the economic crisis.\n\n## 3. **Monetary Policy Mistakes**\n\n- **Federal Reserve Actions:** The Federal Reserve failed to provide adequate liquidity to banks and allowed the money supply to contract sharply. Instead of lowering interest rates and injecting money into the economy, the Fed raised rates in 1931 to defend the gold standard, worsening deflation and economic contraction.\n- **Deflation:** Falling prices increased the real burden of debt and discouraged investment and consumption.\n\n## 4. **Decline in International Trade**\n\n- **Hawley-Smoot Tariff (1930):** The U.S. government raised tariffs on imported goods to protect American industries. Other countries retaliated with their own tariffs, leading to a collapse in international trade.\n- **Global Impact:** The depression spread worldwide, as countries dependent on exports to the U.S. suffered severe economic downturns.\n\n## 5. **Overproduction and Underconsumption**\n\n- **Industrial and Agricultural Overproduction:** Advances in technology and productivity led to overproduction in both industry and agriculture. However, wages for workers did not keep pace, limiting their purchasing power.\n- **Falling Prices and Profits:** Excess supply led to falling prices, reduced profits, and layoffs", "timestamp": 1770753548.674434}
