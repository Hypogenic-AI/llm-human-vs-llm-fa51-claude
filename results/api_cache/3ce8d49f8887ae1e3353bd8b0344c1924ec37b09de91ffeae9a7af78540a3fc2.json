Without it, Earth would be about -18\u00b0C (0\u00b0F) instead of our current average of 15\u00b0C (59\u00b0F). Life as we know it wouldn't exist.\n\n**Enhanced greenhouse effect** = Problem. Human activities (burning fossil fuels, deforestation) have increased CO\u2082 levels by ~50% since pre-industrial times, trapping extra heat and causing global warming.\n\nThink of it like a blanket\u2014some covering keeps you comfortable, but too many layers make you overheat.", "timestamp": 1770754357.4744174}
