He was Hitler's deputy in the Nazi Party and had flown to Scotland in 1941 in an unauthorized attempt to negotiate peace with Britain. \n\nFor the final 21 years of his imprisonment (from 1966 onwards), he was the sole prisoner in the facility, which was guarded by rotating contingents from the four Allied powers (USA, UK, France, and Soviet Union). After his death, Spandau Prison was demolished to prevent it from becoming a neo-Nazi shrine.", "timestamp": 1770750826.2194622}
