However, this usage is much less common and not standard basketball terminology.\n\nGiven that the term \"nutmeg\" is primarily associated with soccer and not standard basketball vocabulary, and Jayson Tatum is a basketball player, the sentence sounds implausible in terms of typical sports language usage.\n\n**no**", "timestamp": 1770752146.0627806}
