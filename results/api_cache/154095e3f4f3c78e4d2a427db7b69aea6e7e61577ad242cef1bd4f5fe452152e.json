Draymond Green is a well-known NBA basketball player for the Golden State Warriors, not a football player. \"Throwing a touchdown\" is terminology from American football, where a quarterback throws a pass that results in a touchdown.\n\nUnless you are referring to a charity football game, a celebrity event, or using the phrase metaphorically (for example, describing a long, accurate basketball pass as a \"touchdown\"), the sentence would not make sense in a literal sports context.\n\nIf you meant it as a joke or metaphor, it could work in a playful or creative context, but **literally**, Draymond Green has not thrown a touchdown in any official NFL or college football game.", "timestamp": 1770751953.5421839}
