Here's the breakdown:\n\n## The Four Forces\n\n1. **Lift** (upward) - created by the wings\n2. **Weight** (downward) - gravity pulling the plane down\n3. **Thrust** (forward) - from the engines\n4. **Drag** (backward) - air resistance\n\nFor flight, lift must overcome weight, and thrust must overcome drag.\n\n## How Wings Create Lift\n\nThe key is the **wing shape** (airfoil):\n- Wings are curved on top and flatter on bottom\n- As the plane moves forward, air splits around the wing\n- Air traveling over the curved top moves faster than air below\n- **Faster-moving air = lower pressure** (Bernoulli's principle)\n- Higher pressure below the wing pushes it upward = **LIFT**\n\n## Also Important: Angle of Attack\n- Wings tilt slightly upward\n- This deflects air downward\n- By Newton's third law, pushing air down creates an upward force on the wing\n\n## Putting It Together\n\n1. Engines provide **thrust** to move the plane forward\n2. Forward motion forces air over the **wings**\n3. Wings generate **lift** from air pressure differences and deflection\n4. When lift exceeds weight, the plane **rises**\n5. Pilot controls surfaces (flaps, rudder, ailerons) to steer\n\n**Simple version**: Wings are shaped so that moving air creates lower pressure above than below, sucking the plane upward!", "timestamp": 1770754411.7989194}
