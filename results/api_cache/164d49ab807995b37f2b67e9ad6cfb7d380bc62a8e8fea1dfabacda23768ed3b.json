Train on large amounts of data\n2. Identify patterns and relationships\n3. Apply what they've learned to new situations\n\n## Common Examples\n\n- **Virtual assistants** (Siri, Alexa)\n- **Recommendation systems** (Netflix, Spotify)\n- **Image recognition** (photo tagging, medical scans)\n- **Autonomous vehicles**\n- **Chatbots and language models** (like me)\n\n## Types\n\n- **Narrow AI**: Designed for specific tasks (what exists today)\n- **General AI**: Hypothetical human-level intelligence across all domains\n\nIs there a particular aspect of AI you'd like me to dive deeper into?", "timestamp": 1770754429.839596}
