Here\u2019s a simple explanation:\n\n**Blockchain** is like a digital ledger or notebook that records transactions. Instead of being kept in one place, copies of this ledger are shared across many computers.\n\nHere\u2019s how it works:\n\n1. **Transactions** happen (like someone sending money).\n2. **Blocks**: These transactions are grouped together into a \"block.\"\n3. **Chain**: Each new block is linked to the previous one, forming a \"chain\" of blocks\u2014hence, \"blockchain.\"\n4. **Verification**: Many computers (called nodes) check and agree that the transactions are valid.\n5. **Security**: Once a block is added, it\u2019s very hard to change, making the system secure and trustworthy.\n\n**In short:** Blockchain is a secure, shared record of transactions, verified by many computers, and very hard to tamper with.", "timestamp": 1770753423.8858085}
