Think of it as \"too much money chasing too few goods.\"\n- Strong economic growth\n- Increased consumer spending\n- Government stimulus programs\n\n## 2. **Cost-Push Inflation**\nWhen production costs rise, forcing businesses to raise prices:\n- Higher wages\n- Increased raw material costs\n- Supply chain disruptions\n- Energy price spikes\n\n## 3. **Monetary Inflation**\nWhen there's too much money in circulation:\n- Central banks printing money\n- Low interest rates encouraging borrowing\n- Excessive credit expansion\n\n## 4. **Built-In Inflation**\nA self-perpetuating cycle:\n- Workers demand higher wages to keep up with rising prices\n- Businesses raise prices to cover higher wage costs\n- Creates an ongoing spiral\n\n## 5. **External Factors**\n- Currency devaluation\n- Import price increases\n- Global commodity shocks (like oil)\n\n**In practice**, inflation usually results from a combination of these factors rather than just one. For example, recent inflation has involved supply chain issues (cost-push), pandemic stimulus (monetary), and strong post-lockdown demand (demand-pull) all at once.\n\nDoes any particular aspect interest you more?", "timestamp": 1770754498.8114562}
