Understanding GPS requires examining its components, underlying principles, and operational mechanics.\n\n## 1. The Three Segments of GPS\n\n### Space Segment\n- **31 operational satellites** orbiting Earth at approximately 20,200 km (12,550 miles) altitude\n- Satellites arranged in **6 orbital planes**, inclined at 55\u00b0 to the equator\n- Each satellite completes **two orbits per day**\n- This configuration ensures at least 4 satellites are visible from any point on Earth at any time\n\n### Control Segment\n- **Master Control Station** in Colorado Springs, Colorado\n- Multiple monitoring stations worldwide\n- Ground antennas for satellite communication\n- Functions: tracking satellites, updating orbital data, synchronizing atomic clocks\n\n### User Segment\n- GPS receivers in devices (smartphones, car navigation, surveying equipment)\n- Receives and processes satellite signals\n- Calculates position, velocity, and time\n\n## 2. Fundamental Principles\n\n### Trilateration\nGPS determines position using **trilateration** (often confused with triangulation):\n\n- **Distance measurement**: Each satellite transmits its location and timestamp\n- **Signal travel time**: Receiver calculates how long the signal took to arrive\n- **Distance calculation**: Distance = Speed of light \u00d7 Travel time\n- **Position determination**: Intersection of spheres from multiple satellites pinpoints location\n\n### Why Four Satellites?\n\nWhile three satellites could theoretically determine a 3D position, **four satellites are needed** because:\n1. **Three satellites** provide latitude, longitude, and altitude\n2. **Fourth satellite** corrects for clock errors in the receiver\n3. Atomic clocks in satellites are extremely precise, but receiver clocks are not\n\n## 3. How Position is Calculated\n\n### Step-by-Step Process\n\n**Step 1: Signal Transmission**\n- Each satellite continuously broadcasts:\n  - Unique identification code\n  - Current time (from onboard atomic clock)\n  - Orbital position (ephemeris data)\n  - System health status\n\n**Step 2: Signal Reception**\n- Receiver picks up signals from multiple", "timestamp": 1770754061.8361819}
