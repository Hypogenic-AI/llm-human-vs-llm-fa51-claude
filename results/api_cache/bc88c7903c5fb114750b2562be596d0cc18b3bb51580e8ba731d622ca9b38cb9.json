This process typically takes 24-72 hours from ingestion to elimination.\n\n## Major Components and Their Functions\n\n### 1. **The Mouth (Oral Cavity)**\n- **Mechanical digestion**: Teeth grind and tear food into smaller pieces\n- **Chemical digestion begins**: Salivary glands produce saliva containing amylase, which starts breaking down carbohydrates\n- **Formation of bolus**: The tongue shapes chewed food into a swallowable mass\n\n### 2. **The Esophagus**\n- A muscular tube approximately 25 cm long\n- Uses **peristalsis** (wave-like muscle contractions) to push food toward the stomach\n- The lower esophageal sphincter prevents stomach acid from flowing backward\n\n### 3. **The Stomach**\n- **Storage**: Holds 1-2 liters of food\n- **Mechanical breakdown**: Muscular walls churn food\n- **Chemical digestion**: Gastric juice (containing hydrochloric acid and pepsin) breaks down proteins\n- **Production of chyme**: Food becomes a semi-liquid mixture\n- **Intrinsic factor secretion**: Necessary for vitamin B12 absorption\n\n### 4. **The Small Intestine**\nThe primary site of nutrient absorption, approximately 6 meters long, divided into three sections:\n\n**a) Duodenum (first 25 cm)**\n- Receives bile from the gallbladder (emulsifies fats)\n- Receives pancreatic enzymes (digest proteins, fats, and carbohydrates)\n- Neutralizes acidic chyme with bicarbonate\n\n**b) Jejunum (middle section)**\n- Primary absorption site for nutrients\n- Contains numerous villi and microvilli to maximize surface area\n\n**c) Ileum (final section)**\n- Absorbs vitamin B12, bile salts, and remaining nutrients\n- Contains Peyer's patches (immune tissue)\n\n### 5. **The Large Intestine", "timestamp": 1770754566.8629804}
