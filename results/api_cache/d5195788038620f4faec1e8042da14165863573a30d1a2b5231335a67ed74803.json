It is made up of a variety of cells, tissues, and organs that work together to recognize and neutralize harmful substances.\n\n---\n\n**Main Components of the Immune System**\n\n1. **Physical and Chemical Barriers**\n   - **Skin:** Acts as a physical barrier to block pathogens.\n   - **Mucous membranes:** Line the respiratory, digestive, and urogenital tracts, trapping microbes.\n   - **Secretions:** Such as saliva, tears, and stomach acid, contain enzymes and acids that destroy pathogens.\n\n2. **Innate (Non-Specific) Immunity**\n   - **First line of defense.**\n   - **Cells involved:** Phagocytes (e.g., neutrophils, macrophages), natural killer (NK) cells, dendritic cells.\n   - **Mechanisms:** These cells recognize general features of pathogens and respond quickly, often within minutes or hours.\n   - **Inflammation:** A key innate response that brings immune cells to the site of infection, causing redness, heat, swelling, and pain.\n\n3. **Adaptive (Specific) Immunity**\n   - **Second line of defense, slower but highly specific.**\n   - **Cells involved:** Lymphocytes (B cells and T cells).\n   - **B cells:** Produce antibodies that specifically target and neutralize pathogens.\n   - **T cells:** \n     - **Helper T cells (CD4+):** Coordinate the immune response.\n     - **Cytotoxic T cells (CD8+):** Destroy infected or abnormal cells.\n   - **Memory cells:** After an infection, some B and T cells become memory cells, allowing for a faster and stronger response if the same pathogen invades again (basis for immunity and vaccination).\n\n---\n\n**How the Immune Response Works**\n\n1. **Recognition**\n   - The immune system distinguishes between \u201cself\u201d (the body\u2019s own cells) and \u201cnon-self\u201d (foreign invaders) using molecules called antigens.\n   - When a pathogen enters the body, its antigens are recognized as foreign.\n\n2. **Activation**\n   - Innate immune cells respond first, engulfing and destroying invaders.\n   -", "timestamp": 1770753364.4747167}
