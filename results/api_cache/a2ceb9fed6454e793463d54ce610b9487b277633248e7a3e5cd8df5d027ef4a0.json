Here\u2019s a simple explanation:\n\nThe internet is like a huge network that connects millions of computers all over the world. When you use the internet, your device sends information (like a message or a website request) through wires, cables, or wireless signals to other computers. These computers (called servers) store websites and information.\n\nThe information travels in small pieces called \"packets.\" These packets move through different devices (like routers) that help them find the fastest path to their destination. Once all the packets arrive, your device puts them back together so you can see the website, video, or message you wanted.\n\nSo, the internet is just a way for computers to talk to each other and share information quickly!", "timestamp": 1770753490.1257458}
