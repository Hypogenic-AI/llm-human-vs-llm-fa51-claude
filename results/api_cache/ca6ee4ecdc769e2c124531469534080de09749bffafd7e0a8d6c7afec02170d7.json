Unlike ordinary matter (the stuff that makes up stars, planets, and you), dark matter **does not emit, absorb, or reflect light**, making it invisible and detectable only through its gravitational effects.\n\n### What do we know about dark matter?\n- **It has mass:** We know it exists because of the way galaxies rotate and how light bends (gravitational lensing) as it passes near massive objects. The visible matter alone can't account for these effects.\n- **It doesn't interact with light:** That's why it's called \"dark.\" It doesn't emit or interact with electromagnetic radiation.\n- **It's not made of atoms:** Ordinary matter (protons, neutrons, electrons) can't explain the observed effects.\n\n### What is it made of?\nWe **don't know exactly**. Some leading candidates include:\n- **WIMPs (Weakly Interacting Massive Particles):** Hypothetical particles that interact via gravity and possibly the weak nuclear force.\n- **Axions:** Extremely light, hypothetical particles.\n- **Sterile neutrinos:** A type of neutrino that doesn't interact via the weak force.\n\n### What isn't dark matter?\n- **Not black holes or regular matter:** There isn't enough regular matter to account for the effects, and black holes would have other observable consequences.\n- **Not antimatter:** Antimatter would annihilate with matter and produce detectable radiation.\n\n### Why is it important?\nUnderstanding dark matter is crucial for explaining:\n- The structure and formation of galaxies.\n- The overall shape and fate of the universe.\n\n**In summary:**  \nDark matter is an unknown, invisible substance that exerts gravity but doesn't interact with light, and it's one of the biggest mysteries in modern physics and astronomy.", "timestamp": 1770753815.5733347}
