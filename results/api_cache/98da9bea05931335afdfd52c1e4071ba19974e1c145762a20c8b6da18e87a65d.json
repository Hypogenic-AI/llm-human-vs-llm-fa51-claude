There's also the **chimera**, which combines multiple animal parts but typically has a lion's head and body, goat's head on its back, and serpent tail.\n\nCould you be thinking of one of these, or perhaps a specific regional variation? Or is this from a particular mythology or fictional work I might not be recalling?", "timestamp": 1770750928.4957612}
