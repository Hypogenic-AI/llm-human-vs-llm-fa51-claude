Jack Flaherty is a pitcher who has played in the National League (primarily with the St. Louis Cardinals), and pitchers in the National League bat for themselves (at least they did before the universal DH rule was implemented in 2022). \n\nWalking to first base after being walked by the opposing pitcher is a common occurrence in baseball. Flaherty has appeared in the NLCS, so this scenario could definitely have happened.", "timestamp": 1770752138.0187876}
