It describes how water circulates through different parts of the environment. The main stages of the water cycle are:\n\n1. **Evaporation**: Water from oceans, lakes, rivers, and other bodies of water turns into water vapor due to the heat from the sun.\n2. **Condensation**: The water vapor rises into the atmosphere, cools down, and changes back into tiny droplets, forming clouds.\n3. **Precipitation**: When the droplets in clouds combine and become heavy, they fall back to the Earth as rain, snow, sleet, or hail.\n4. **Collection (or Runoff)**: The water collects in oceans, rivers, lakes, and the ground. Some of it soaks into the soil and becomes groundwater, while the rest flows back into larger bodies of water.\n\nThis cycle repeats over and over, ensuring that water is always moving and being recycled throughout the environment.", "timestamp": 1770753721.189145}
