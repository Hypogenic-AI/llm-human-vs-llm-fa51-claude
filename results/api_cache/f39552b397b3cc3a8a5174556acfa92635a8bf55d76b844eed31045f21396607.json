It represents an invisible form of matter that does not emit, absorb, or reflect light or any other electromagnetic radiation, making it completely undetectable by conventional telescopes. Despite being invisible, dark matter constitutes approximately 85% of all matter in the universe and about 27% of the universe's total mass-energy content.\n\n## Evidence for Dark Matter\n\n### 1. **Galaxy Rotation Curves**\nOne of the strongest pieces of evidence comes from observing how galaxies rotate. According to Newtonian physics, stars farther from a galaxy's center should orbit more slowly than those closer in. However, observations show that stars at the outer edges move just as fast as those near the center, suggesting the presence of additional, unseen mass creating extra gravitational pull.\n\n### 2. **Gravitational Lensing**\nEinstein's theory of general relativity predicts that massive objects bend spacetime, causing light to curve around them. Astronomers observe light from distant galaxies being bent by seemingly empty space, indicating the presence of invisible mass\u2014dark matter\u2014acting as a gravitational lens.\n\n### 3. **Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB)**\nPrecise measurements of the CMB radiation (the afterglow of the Big Bang) reveal patterns that can only be explained if dark matter exists and influenced the early universe's structure formation.\n\n### 4. **Galaxy Cluster Dynamics**\nThe motion of galaxies within clusters and the distribution of hot gas require much more gravitational mass than visible matter can provide, pointing to substantial dark matter presence.\n\n## What Dark Matter Is NOT\n\n- **Not ordinary matter (baryonic matter)**: Dark matter is not made of atoms or their components (protons, neutrons, electrons)\n- **Not dark clouds of normal matter**: Hydrogen clouds or dust would absorb or emit some radiation\n- **Not antimatter**: Antimatter annihilation would produce detectable gamma rays\n- **Not black holes**: There aren't enough black holes to account for the observed effects\n\n## Leading Theoretical Candidates\n\n### 1. **WIMPs (Weakly Interacting Massive Particles)**\nHypothetical particles that interact through gravity and the weak nuclear", "timestamp": 1770754548.7337255}
