While this effect is natural and necessary for life, human activities have intensified it dramatically since the Industrial Revolution, causing global temperatures to rise.\n\n## **The Scale**\n\nCO\u2082 levels are now higher than any point in at least 800,000 years, and global average temperatures have risen about 1.1\u00b0C since pre-industrial times.\n\n**Is there a particular aspect you'd like to explore more deeply?**", "timestamp": 1770753856.8164213}
