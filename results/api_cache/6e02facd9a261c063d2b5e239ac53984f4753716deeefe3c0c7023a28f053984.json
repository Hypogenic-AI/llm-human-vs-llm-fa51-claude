In baseball, a player \"walks to first base\" when they receive a base on balls (a \"walk\") while batting. Jack Flaherty is primarily a pitcher, not known for his hitting, but more importantly, pitchers rarely bat in the National League Championship Series (NLCS) since the designated hitter (DH) rule has been adopted in recent years. Even before the universal DH, it would be unusual but not impossible for a pitcher to walk. However, the phrasing \"walked to first base\" implies he was a batter who received a walk, which is unlikely but not impossible. So, while highly improbable, it is technically possible. \n\nBut if you are asking strictly about plausibility: **Yes, it is plausible**, though unlikely.", "timestamp": 1770751843.0052972}
