He is not associated with baseball.\n\n2. The **National League Championship Series (NLCS)** is a postseason baseball series in Major League Baseball (MLB) in the United States, not related to soccer.\n\n3. The phrase \"watched the pitch go by\" is a baseball term, referring to a batter not swinging at a pitch. In soccer, \"pitch\" refers to the playing field, but in this context, it's clearly a baseball reference.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe sentence mixes a famous soccer player's name with a baseball event and terminology, making it implausible unless it's meant as a joke or in a fictional context.", "timestamp": 1770752049.7713006}
