        "response": "Electric timing devices and a public-address system were used for the first time at the **1932 Summer Olympics** held in Los Angeles, USA.\n\n**Reasoning and Details:**\n\n- **Electric Timing Devices:**  \n  The 1932 Los Angeles Olympics marked a significant technological advancement in sports timing. For the first time, electric timing devices were used to record athletes' performances, providing greater accuracy and reliability compared to manual stopwatches. This innovation was particularly important for track and field events, where fractions of a second could determine medal placements.\n\n- **Public-Address System:**  \n  The same Games also saw the introduction of a public-address (PA) system. This allowed announcements and information to be broadcast clearly to spectators throughout the stadium, greatly enhancing the experience for attendees and improving communication during the events.\n\n**Sources:**  \n- International Olympic Committee (IOC) historical records  \n- Official Report of the Games of the Xth Olympiad Los Angeles 1932  \n- Olympic.org: [193",

Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg placed a briefcase containing a bomb in a conference room where Hitler was meeting with military officers.

Following the failure, Hitler ordered brutal reprisals\u2014approximately 5,000 people were arrested and around 200 conspirators were executed, including Stauffenberg.",
