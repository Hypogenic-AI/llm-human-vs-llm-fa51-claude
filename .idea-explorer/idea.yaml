idea:
  title: Do LLMs behave differently when the prompter is human vs another LLM?
  domain: nlp
  hypothesis: 'Large language models may exhibit different behaviors depending on
    whether the prompt is written in a human style or in a style characteristic of
    another LLM, even when the content is controlled. This research will test whether
    LLMs respond differently to prompts that are recognizably human versus recognizably
    LLM-generated.

    '
  background:
    description: It seems clear that LLMs can recognize when a text is from a human
      or an LLM. We could make a reasonable assumption that they "expect" prompts
      to come from humans, have human style. What happens if the prompt, controlled
      for content, reads very LLM? Might they behave differently?
